These two philosophers first posed the question (prior to 60s, not much by anthropologists), that was then examined by anthropologists
Jacques Rousseau "noble savage"
Thomas Hobbes "war of all against all" (human societies always practice war, i.e. part of human existence. does not need a reason, nothing to stop it)

Blood Red Roses: The Archaeology of a Mass Grave from the Battle of Townton

10000 years ago (8000BC), northern iraq
people have weapons in skeletons
living in defendable sites
large arrow heads

although not indicators of war, it seems these things 'set the stage' for war:
war comes about because of people living sedentary lives, social hierarchy (people buried differently), long-distance trade
 

(Site 117, Sudan perhaps earlier)

War leaves behind skeletons, settlement patterns, weapons

So essentially, no war before 6000years. War between hunter-gatherers. 
This war intensified with European settlement 

It seems that war was not endemic in societies before 6000/7000 years ago?


Humans have an in-borne tendency to go to war:
Territorial Imperative (Robert Ardery)
African Gensis (Robert Ardery)
On Aggression (Konrad Lorenz)

The advent of european colonialism saw an intensification of war than just between hunter-gatherers
War in the Tribal Zone: Expanding States and Indigenous Warfare 


Napoelon Chagnon, Yanomamo: The Fierce People
Flawed in that it assumes modern day hunter-gatherers exhibit same behaviour as those before.
They are influenced by contemporary European things
Alternative: in a society like yanomamo, can't pay someone to be a warrior, so you reward them with women
Essentially, not enough game to satiate people staying in one place, so resort to violence (malthusian argument)
This makes war something 'rational', rather than something that wells up from our biology
The statistics compiled were only of people alive at the time (not their entire history)
(saying genghis khan had 1000 kids is irrelevent across entire history.)
(look in native american plains people, peace leaders had more kids. only in times of war, did warriors produce more offspring. this is in relation to being a warrior spreads your genes better)


War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage (keeley)
War in Human Civilisation: azar gat
very good for archeology

so, we see more war as time progresses.
the absence of war is not indicative of us not having the evidence, 
we do have skeletons and settlements. just no war 

although war capable 20kya. and 100kya and 
we would have no record if it you have to explain 
why did this go away when the archeological record began?

NOTE: contemporary hunter-gatherers have some sort of settlement, 
so to say that they are the same as 20kya. is wrong
also something like the nomadic horse-gatherers are hunter-gatherers, 
yet they use horses from the Spanish. so obviously not able to translate their actions to the past


The Human Potential for Peace: An Anthropological Challenge to Assumptions about War and Violence
very few violence in the most simple of societies
Warless Societies and the Origin of War

Steven Pinker: the history of violence
civilisation isn't the cause of violence, it's helping us overcome it.
counter: if you look at mesopatamian civisiliations, a lot of violence increase there...

The purely Roussean idea to get rid of violence is to go back to the Stone Age 


demonic males richard wrangham:
chimps go on raiding parties and stomp other chimps. evidence of violence genes dating back millions of years
counter: these are cases of disturbed chimps. there are whole other hosts of violence going on there, e.g. killing females in same group, children (not good for reproductive success); hyptohesising due to human impact
in general, like humans, they develop a continous range of behaviour

in general I think violence is learned, either culturally or because of the immediate environment, e.g. scarcity of resources

You are to evaluate the various theories that have been proposed and choose the one
which best fits the evidence.

Your paper must be argumentative and analytical.

Each paragraph presents only one idea


Go against what Roussea.

NOT: primitive warfare was very ritualistic, few casualties

humans have always be capable of war



TO ASK:
BOOK MAKES SUMMARIES OF FINDINGS. SO, ALTHOUGH TALKING ABOUT SAY 5 DIFFERENT PRIMARY SOURCES, TALKING ABOUT IT IS JUST 1? HOW TO INCLUDE PROPERLY WITHOUT JUST REHASHING WHAT THEY SAID?
PERHAPS JUST SPLIT UP THE SAME ARGUMENT ACROSS DIFFERENT BOOKS?

----------------------------------------------------
War can be defined as collective violence between two or more groups. (social pattern of violence?)
The two sides of the debate regarding humanity's propensity for war were first articulated centuries ago by philosopher's Roussea and Hobbes.
Roussea proposed the "noble savage", stating that humanity was entirely peaceful before the advent of civilisation.
Hobbes characterised the state of human nature as a "war of all against all", meaning that war is an inborn tendency in humans.  
By examining osteological and archeological evidence, a midline can be drawn between Roussean and Hobbsian ideologies.
Specifically, war is not an innate part of human existence and has increased in response to the development of sedentary cultures and complex social hierarchies.

1 Jean-Jacques Rousseau (Discourse on the Origins of Inequality Among Men (1754))
2 Thomas Hobbes ((De Cive) 1642)

1. war has intensified after the mesolithic period? 8000-onwards
Analysing the abundance of skeletal remains from the late Paelolithic () to early Neolithic (), evidence of war although present, is largely absent.
Osteological evidence of warfare can be considered..... These are unlikely to be mistaken for ....
332 (presence and absence) for summary. before that, for actual osteological discussion



which leads to the conclusion that humans come from a sporadically violent past.

Stone age (paleolithic, (10000-8000)mesolithic, (-2300)neolithic), bronze age, iron age

kelly pg. 124 (war is an episodic feature of human history observed at certain times and places, but not others)

(war is not a primordial feature of human life)

perhaps kelly pg. 125 summarises the absences of war in terms of dates best?

2. war has itensified as a result of sendentary? (keely evidence, ferguson for reasons why)

The development of agricultural and farming settlements in the early Neolithic period 
catalysed a sedentary way of human life, ultimately leading to an increase in warlike engagements.
Investigating the colonisation of Central and North West Europe by LBK (Linienbandkeramik) farmers, 
this transition is highly evident. 
Radiocarbon dating of LBK stone tools and pottery show their arrival to have occurred approximately 7000 years ago, i.e. early Neolithic. (keely)
Pollen analysis performed on LBK sites show evidence of land clearing,
while inspection of LBK food remains show a diet consisting almost entirely of agricultural foods. (keely)
LBK culture was not in any way comparable to the culture of the native Mesolithic foragers. (keely)
The similarity between the radiocarbon dates of the latest Mesolithic sites 
and earliest LBK sites indicate Mesolithic lifeways died quickly following LBK arrival. (keely)
Therefore, LBK farmers represent a marked transition to a more sedentary way of human life.
There are both short-term and long-term consequences of the sedentary LBK culture that create 
an environment where warfare seems reasonable.
In the short-term, a sedentary culture intrudes on the land of native foragers who are unable to 
yeild territory due to their scattered food sources.
In the long-term, a sedentary culture removes the ability to move away from situations building
to violence. (ferguson)
Furthermore, as resources are no longer fluctuating or scattered, there is less need to 
maintain cooperative bonds with others as was essential in humanity's evolutionary past.
(jurmain, et. al 2016)
Evidence of warfare in LBK culture can be seen in the remains of fortified settlements
(v-shaped ditches and palisades), stockpiling of weapons in enclosures (arrow-heads and axes) 
and mass burial graves containing skeletons with perimortem cranial trauma consistent 
with LBK axe blows (Talheim death pit). (keely)
Although only analysing the LBK colonisation, it's reasonable to assume that other sedentary
culture colonisations that occured during the Neolithic period share many similarities.
Consequently, it's clear that the development of sedentary cultures increased the frequency 
of warlike interactions.

LBK culture, so radiocarbon dating of the pottery shows when agricultural/farming started to grow in central/northern Europe?
Determine their diet was primarily agricultural as wild plants and animals not seen in diet.
The very nature of this type of agricultural economy is to disrupt native ecology, replace indigenous flora/fauana with own crops
This invades the native foragers, resulting in colonists developing institutional ways of dealing with the natives  
More evidence in start of Chapter 11
end of pg 312. "only after we accept warfare as an normal part of life, can we understand these inexplicable features" 

3. war has intensified as a result of social hierarchy?
pg 310 (weapons only found in burials of older men, indicating symbols of acheived status)
materials made from 'exotic' materials not near the area
pg 336.
increasing hierarchy and centralisation leads to intensification of war
evolution of contending political parties (Dunbar's number)
fostering a greater reliance on central decision making (away from egalatarian societies). interest's tilt towards the few
pursue war, interests must be garnered
seek to raise their position in society
must be a need and a militarily acheivable solution
pg. 257 human trophy taking as prestige enhancement 

kelly pg. 125: the fact people made it to New World and Australia demonstrates a degree of social heirarchy in order to sustain the environments (organsiation structure that has seen success in colonising unknown areas, kelly pg. 127)
kelly pg. 126: difficult to integrate multiple socities without conflict as seen in great apes  
kelly pg. 126: unsegmented foraging societies are typically egalatarian
kelly pg. 130: distinctions of reasons for violence between hunter-gatherers and structured societies (cheifdoms etc.)


(should we preface with saying that these assertions are the more plausable scenarios?)
EVIDENCE OF WAR:
Osteology (unlikely to be mistaken for spousal abuse, sports, rituals, sacrifices etc.):
bone-embedded points like arrows
high frequency of cranial compression fractures
absent limbs
multiple burials

where a cultural tradition is known from many sites and skeletons, absence of warfare is not absence of evidence axiom. 
it just wasn't there


EVIDENCE OF SEDENTARY:
fortifications; walls of jericho

EVIDENCE OF SOCIAL STRUCTURE:





War is not an innate part of human existence and has increased as a result of
1, 2, 3 (a mid-line between Roussea and Hobbes)
war comes about because of people living sedentary lives (settlements; agriculture),
social hierarchy (political structures to organise public opinion; self-interest to gain; people buried differently), 
long-distance trade (raiding precious materials, expanding trade network, protecting trade routes)

1st paragraph on the absence of violence in the archeological record

humans have come from a sporadically violent past

in egalitarian societies, man decides on war for himself

in these conditions, it's unlikely that a group would risk 
at the cost of more effort and greater hazard

material interests that 

evidence indicates a late emergence of violence/war

By analysing skeletal remains from various sites 

War leaves behind skeletons, settlement patterns, weapons
