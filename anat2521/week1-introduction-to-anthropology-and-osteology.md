# Week 1 - Introduction to Anthropology and Osteology
* Primates (monkeys) -> hominoidea (gibbons) -> homindae (oraguntan) -> 
  hominiae (gorilla, chimpanzee) -> hominins (humans)
* Stone age (paleolithic, mesolithic, neolithic), bronze age, iron age
* DNA contains genetic instructions. 
* A gene is small section of DNA responsible for a particular trait.
* To evolve, genes must change (different to adaptation). 
  If resulting in speciation it is macroevolution (microevolution is within a species)
* Culture is behaviour passed down from nonbiological means. 
* Science is observation and experimentation, 
  (observing and experimenting literal definition of empirical)
* Called theory as it has been substantially verified through experimentation 
  (allows for new insight from emerging technologies; not about defining absolute truths)

All life evolved from the same origin, meaning we share a connection to all living things 
(as evidenced by DNA)
Evolutionary theory (particularly natural selection) explains this change

Anthropology is holistic and is the study of humans over time. 
Separated into:
1. Cultural (ethnicities)
2. Linguistic 
3. Archeology (artifacts - used by hominins) 
4. Physical/biological (explore how and why humans have evolved genetically, physically and behaviourally; key word evolved)
Within physical anthropology 
(paleoanthropology, primatology, human biology, paleopathology, 
forensic anthropology, bioarcheology etc.)

Originally anthropologists concerned with visible differences (osteology), 
now more genetic, e.g. physical responses under stimuli like running at alitude, diet, etc. 

Humans are unique in that our behaviour is largely determined by culture. 
In fact, our culture has influenced our biological makeup leading to humans being products 
of biocultural evolution

Bioarchelogy can reveal burial practices, weapons used (from antemortem or perimortem trauma), religious offerings, body modifications, community worldview
Easier to obtain mitochondrial dna than nuclear dna as more cells. However less obtained in them.

Ethical issues in Australia with indigienous communities not wanting skeletal remains to be uncovered (Mungo man)

radius notch is more medial
way patella tilts gives side
identify what side bone goes on
gotcha with thumb/big toe phalange number
identify top and bottom, then things which point medially/laterally

-----------------------------------
Primates are a very long lived species like humans.
If humans obtain things culturally then they could be suboptimal. 
If we learn from primates that know things biologically, is their way of behaving could be more optimal than ours.
Applied anthropology in resting positions (perhaps even child-rearing) 

Exploring things that are instinctively biological in humans is a grey-area delving into psychology.

When stating 206 bone count, it does not include sesamoid bones.
This is common in anatomy books that mention a 'magic number'. 
They don't take into account variability, e.g. saying that Homo Sapians appeared 200,000 years ago is not exact  

'Hobbits' in Flores, Indoensia caves were Homo Erectus living about 20,000 years ago

Gaps in bones could be because it's a young child where some bone is separated by cartilage, e.g. fontanelles

Closer to equator, smaller trunk longer arms for evaporation as larger surface area.

More accurate to use 'European Ancestry' as oppose to Caucasian.

what about the variability of the coccyx? (3 - 5 segments in coccyx?)
