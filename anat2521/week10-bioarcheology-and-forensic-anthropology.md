# Week 10 - Bioarcheology and Forensic Anthropology
Bioarcheology is the study of human bones with contextual understanding of the archeological site they come from
Derived from processual archeology movement (merge with cultural studies)
So, understanding culture change, i.e. why something happened and thereby somebody's worldview:
* burial practices, sacrifice, mummification -> religious views
* culturally meaningful age/sex categories -> social identity
* diet, health, mobility
* urbanism, sedentism, domestication

Encompasses a number of methodologies:
* paleodemography (age and sex)
* paleopathology (trauma, body modification):
tuberculosis: degeneration of particular thoracic vertebrae
syphilis: skull lesions
congenital microcheplia: small brain
nutritional rickets: unusually flexible
degenerative osteoarthritis
(most diseases leave no traces on skeleton at all; especially acute as die quickly)

types of bone fractures: (ante,peri(adhering flakes),postmortem(sharp edges))
  - transverse (line break)
  - oblique (line break at an angle)
  - comminuted (many little fracture)
  - greenstick (ends of bone not entirely displaced)
  - compression fracture
  - compound fracture (serious bone deviation)

trephination (removal of part of cranial for surgical purposes, e.g. relieve blood pressure)

* activity patterns
wolff's law: bone adapts to load under which it's placed (musculo-skeletal stress markers; larger deltoid tuberosity). opposite is true

* relationships/biological distance (dna)
nonmetric: shovel shaped incisor

* isotope analysis
diet: C13, N15 in protein component of bone and teeth, i.e. collagen
 - C4 photosynthetic pathway are tropical grasses, producing more C13 (new world, maize, sugarcane)
 - C3 are forest plants; rice, wheat, oats, legumes 
more N15 is more meat/seafood
mobility: Sr isotope in rock->soil->plants/water/fauna. So, can identify if someone was buried where they lived

hot humid environment not good for preservation of DNA

forensic anthropology is bioarcheology to medicolegal contexts. so, work with fragments as oppose to what a medical conveyer at the morgue would be used to 
1. human vs non-human: in NSW, large number of cases are just telling the police it's a kangaroo bone not human
2. ancient vs recent
First, establish datum. Then if buried, excavate with archeological techniques. Then process in lab and ensure chain of custody
Establish biological profile (age, sex, stature, injuries, facial reconstruction)
Daubert standard (legal case establishing guideless accessing the of admissibility of technical testimony)
Establish cause of death (trauma). 'thumbnail' fractures from fire. distinguish between cultural and normal taphonomic incidences
Time since death (quicker decomposition if on surface, unwrapped, warm, humid)
Involved in natural disasters, war crimes, terrorism

score shovel-shaped incisor assessable. more triangular wedged

caries very common between joining of molars and on top of cusps on molars
black marks

antemortem tooth sockets fully resolved

spongy bone is student damage

arthiritis look at joints, e.g. articular joints, verterbral body.
will be enlarged and some pockets and bone plate growth

archeological context, e.g. status, regional important to establish greater understanding

asymmetry of line on nasal bone indicates fracture, 
i.e. fracture line not on middle or side sutures
smoothness of line indicates it has had time for bony re-healing 

identify and ascertain what it can tell us

-------------------------------------------------------------

everything is give and take in evolution, e.g. the knee and back have not fully evolved
for bipedalism as seen in other primates and mammals

What is post-processual archeology?
cultures with 3rd gender?
