# Week 2 - Evolutionary Theory and Aging and Sexing
* Species is homo sapiens 
* Genus is homo (things that have a lot in common) 
* Family is hominidae
* Order is primates
* Class is mammals
* Phylum is chordata (nerve cord and skeleton)
* Kingdom is animalia (multicellular that move about and ingest food)

* Genome is the entire DNA makeup of individual
* Cell is fundamental unit of life
  Eukaroytic:
    - Nucleus ➞ DNA (23 pairs of chromosomes; 23rd are XY in males, XX in females), 
                RNA (transcribe DNA for translation in ribosome)
    - Cytoplasm ➞ Mitochondria (ATP energy and mtDNA), 
                  Ribosomes (amino acid/protein synthesis)
  - Somatic cells ➞ body tissue
    * Mitosis is splitting into 2 diploid cells.
  - Gametes ➞ reproduction (egg cells and sperm cells forming zygote)
    * Meisosis is splitting into 4 haploid cells (genetic diversity)

* Phenotype are observed characteristic of gene
  Environmental factors can also affect phenotype

* Chromosome is how DNA is packaged
  One point in an autosome item will have a corresponding point on it's pair.
  Locus is a specific point on a chromosome.
  Genotype are the alleles at a specific locus
  Dominant gene only requires hetereozygous genotype (not necessarily better, e.g. Marfan's)
  Inbreeding increases the chances of an individual having homozygous recessive
  A Mendelian trait is one which is determined at a single locus
  Polygenic is multiple loci:
    - Mendelian inheritence still applies to each individual locus
    - Protein-encoding and/or regulatory genes
  Pleiotropy is where a single gene affects multiple phenotypes 
  Punnet squares just give probabilty distribution (as DNA is random)

* DNA governs cellular activity. It's the basis of all life.
  It can replicate and produce/regulate proteins.
  Sugars and phosphates form sides, complementary bases (A, G, T, C) form rungs. 
  Nucleotide is one individual side.
  Three bases (triplet or codon) form a recipe for an amino acid.
  Amino acids are structurally the same in all species.

* A protein is formed from amino acids
  20 amino acids, 8 essential (from foods), 12 non-essential 
  They function by binding to other molecules 
  An enzyme is a protein that regulates a chemical reaction
  A hormone is a protein that is released into the bloodstream to affect another tissue

* Gene is a sequence of DNA bases
  Regulatory genes are what allow for distinct cells like human liver and bone 
  Regulatory DNA evolves quicker. 
  Humans have highest concentration of this than any other species studied

* Allele is variant of a gene (think about chromosome pairs)

* Biological species (reproductively isolated):
  - Premating Isolating Mechanisms
     * Habitat (arboreal, terrestrial)
     * Temporal (nocturnal, diurnal)
     * Behaviour (nuances of courtship)
     * Mechanical (unable to penetrate)
  - Postmating Isolating Mechanisms (failed egg fertilisation, sterile birth)
  Evolutionary species (phenotypically distinct, so useful in fossils)
  Cladogensis is when species branches into two or more due to geographic isolation (anagensis is one)
  Allopatric speciation from geographic isolation (chimpanzees to bonobos Congo river)
  Parapatric speciation have adjacent regions with large geographic area (baboons)

* Fossil is any trace organism, e.g. insect in resin, bone, etc.(requires mineralisation)
  In reality, very rare that circumstances allow for a terrestrial life-form to be fossilised
  Within fossils we have age and sexual dimorphism variations
  Can only accurately determine by comparing with currently living closely-linked species

* Fixation of species was questioned as Europeans travelled and discovered new fossils/animals.
  There was some Non-Western knowledge prior, however no formalisation of it so it stayed hidden.

* Evolution is change in allele frequency
  Is not directional, e.g. peppered moths
  Gene flow is movement of genes between populations
  Genetic drift is random changes in gene frequency
  Genetic bottle-neck is the loss of alleles due to some event, e.g. extinction event (cheetahs have little genetic diversity)
  Evolution is two stages:
    1. Variation/mutation (in gamete)
         - Base/point (replacement of base in an amino acid)
         - Chromosomal (reordering, deletion, etc.)
       Mitochondrial DNA is inherited soley from the mother
       Hox regulatory gene highly influential in embryonic development
    2. Natural selection (fitness from selective pressures)
         - Environmental, geographical, cultural (antler size, peacock feathers, etc.), founders effect/adaptive radiation
       Gradualism (slow and steady), punctuated equilibrium (bursts of change; more common)
       Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium states that allele frequency only changes with evolutionary forces (self-evident?)

   Verterbrae evolution (geological eras): 
     - Paleozoic (500 mya; Pangea)
       Largely fish/amphibians
     - Mesozoic (Gondwanaland + Lauraisia) 
       Largely reptiles/dinosaurs, later mammals (larger brains, varied shaped teeth, endothermic)
     - Cenozoic (current)
       Placental mammals dominant (in-utero)

* Pedigree is lineage
  Similar traits from common ancestor is homology (similarity in mammalian skeletal forelimbs)
  From independent ancestors is homoplasy/analogy (assume these are not common for assumptions to be made) 
  A clade is a group sharing a common ancestor
  - Cladistics:
    Determines homologies that distinguish members of a clade, i.e. derived homologies
    Will produce a cladogram (just ancestor-descendor relationships)
  - Evolutionary systematics: 
    Will produce a phylogeny (lineage with time markers in mya; difficult to do as many more extinct species)
  Utilise both to form a complete picture

------------------------------------------------------------------------
if mapped the human genome in 2003, how does this affect genetic engineering/disease treatments? 
(human genome took sample people and analysed theirs. as most sections are the same for most people use that as a template. however does it also map non-coding?)
(Polygenic traits, we haven't determined all loci involved?)
is the number of chromosomes specific to each species?
will the length of every person's chromosome pairs be the same?
genome project is only protein-coding DNA? 
the other is the ongoing ENCODE project?
What is random assortment or the randomness of DNA? If mapped genome, how can positions differ? If random, how can we say person will recieve Marfan's?

mapping the human genome means that we have identified particular sections of a chromosome 
that are responsible for particular traits?
so, alterations within the bases of these sections (alleles) 
will produce variations of this trait?

If DNA is randomly assorted, how can you have a locus? 
also what about chromosomal mutation?

if evolution change in frequency of alleles, 
you can evolve but not speciate? nuances here

bones could have microbial damage from soil, termites, roots of trees, stone damage from a collapse, etc.

natural selection on phenotype

dna can determine if interbred if early fossil (biologicial species)

earlist use of tool use from bone damage

tool use on megafauna bones

be part of ongoing project/facebook groups to know modern techniques

squatting facets on tibia
ancient beds in iraq (archeological evidence of beds)
plant species brought into the cave 
arrangement of pieces (length of extended leg or curled up in fetal position)
