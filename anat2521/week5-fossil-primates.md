# Week 5 - Fossil Primates
Ancestral skeleton traits such as pentadactly, unfused shoulder (clavicle), 
(many postcranial evidence of arboreal living)
divergent such as orthograde (more upright, not necessarily bipedal)

primates primarily evolved in Cenozoiac (65mya.)

last common ancestor (crown group) difficult to pinpoint as includes traits prior to a speciation event (as oppose to a stem group)

convergent evolution is similar trait evolved differently, e.g. mammalian leg, flipper, etc.

Taphonomy: study of occurences to fossils from death to discovery

Petrification (turning to rock), synonmous with fossilisation. 
Inorganic tissues replaced by absorbed minerals
(doesn't have to be skeletal, e.g. coprolite is fossilised faeces)

strata is layer of rock (stratigraphy). older strata is lower, younger cuts through

eon (precambrian, phanerozoic), era (paleo/meso/cenozoic), period (quaternary), 
epoch (pleistocene ice age, holocene)

relative dating techniques, e.g. say something is older than another however no number:
lithostratigraphy (rock layers), tephrostratigraphy (volcanic ash), 
biostratigraphy (faunal succession, i.e. animal we know age of appears somewhere else),
chemical analysis (fluorine), paleomagnetism (magnetic pole reversal)

chronometric dating. carbon-14 for organic materials as eat plants photosythesis (potassium-40 longer half life so useful for older, however requires potassium, e.g. volcano), 
tree rings, uranium, electron spin resonance (pottery, silica, quartz)
various methods applicable to materials present

determining environment:
oxygen-18 (heavier) indicates colder climates and lower sea levels
carbon-13 are grasslands (so, less carbon-13 indicates wooded area)
animals, e.g. monkeys wooded area, hippos water near

mammals around during mesozoic and primates emerged after asteriod into cenozoic
plesiadapiforms quasi-primates from paleocene epoch (prognathic face, i.e. extending mandible)
during this time, flowering plants which attracted insects to pollinate them, so primates vision.

true primates in eocene, adapoids (strepsirhine) and omomyoids (hapolorhine)

monkeys and apes (apidium and aegyptopithecus) from asia to africa. 

old world monkeys in uganda/kenya (victoriapithecus)

earlist apes proconsul (walked on soles, y-5 molars) determined from crania, as postcranial similar to monkeys

when compare to monkeys, humans have unique traits resulting from brachiation:
wide-short thorax, stiff back

the shift to more grasslands meant brachiation not as effective, so old world monkeys more plentiful (in addition to them being more r-selected)

----------------------------------
some guesswork involved and changing, e.g. morotopitehcus bishop better candidate than procunsol; separation of orangutans

conditions for fossilisation have layer of water over fossil? is this good preserving?
(yarramundi body farm)

if original primates ate insects and fruit, when did meat enter diet?

not entirely sure how to reconstruct environmental conditions from isotopes (has to be some fossil to extrapolate from?)
e.g. where are oxygen isotopes found? (in water?)

radiometric dating, so the granularity is half-life?

stone age and subsequent lithics are what?

crown group and stem group? why difficult to pinpoint LCA?

incipient dental comb? there are indications of future evolutions?

is euprimate anachronistic?

plattyrhines into new world via island hopping on natural mats of vegetation? (trees from storms)
accidental colonisation? aborigines on boats?

if life so plentiful and extended ontology of primates, don't understand how so diverse now?
