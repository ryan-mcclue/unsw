# Week 7 - Early Hominins
Defining characteristic of hominins is bipedalism:
anterior foramen magnum, wider os coxae (curved ilium), s-shape spine, medially angled femur, 
longer femur, longer femural neck, thick hallux 

anatomical features of hominins:
decreased facial size. although brain fully size at age 7, not developed until 18
parabolic dental arcade, smaller incisors/canines, thicker enamel for nuts

first hominins in Great Rift Valley, East Africa (receding lakes)

shift to bipedalism resulting from cooling in climate, less forest more savannah  

late Miocene, first signs of hominisation

first potential hominins pre-australopithecus 7mya. than australopithecus 4mya.
branching from australopithecus are homo genus

diastema present with CP3 honing complex

2mya. for first homo fossil

(these are candidate early hominins, possess mosaic of traits, e.g. anterior foramen magnum but divergent big-toe)
(pre-australopithecus)
1. 7-6mya: sahelanthropus tchadensis (chad)
2. 6mya: orrorin tugenensis (kenya)
3. 5.8-5.2mya: ardipithecus kadabba (ethopia)
4. 4.4mya: ardipithecus ramidus (ethopia) --> long arms and phalanges indicates brachiation?
most probable earliest ancestor of hominins

sectorial premolar sharpes/hones canine

(australopithecus the first established hominin genus)
4mya: small brain case, large jaw, small body size, long arms (probably slept in trees). 
broader/funnel shaped rib cage (indicating large gut to digest plant foods)
large sagittal crest for large temporalis muscles, i.e. chewing muscles
lack of feet arches
prognathic, fairly megadont
first stone tool maker (so probably when started to eat meat?)
1. 4.2-3.9mya: australopithecus anamensis (kenya, ethopia)
2. 3.9-2.9mya: australopithecus afarensis (eastern afica, Lucy, Laetoli footprints: ethopia)
australopithecus bahrelghazdi/deyiremedi/garhi (garhi is robust?)

South African Australopithecus fossils found in breccia (broken rock clumped together)
So, fossils died in a sinkhole that is later exposed? So more complex geology than
East Africa Australopithecus fossils as have to isolate age from components of breccia 
3. 3.5-2.0mya: australopithecus africanus: taung child, mrs plez
4. 1.97-1.78mya: australopethicus sediba

(alternative lineage, robust (as oppose to gracile) australopethicus developed larger jaws, 
flaring zygomatics (masseter muscle) and molars)
1. 2.7-2.5mya: australopethicus/paranthropus aethiopicus (east africa)
2. 2.3-1.5mya: australopethicus boisei (nut-cracker man: east africa)
3. 2-1.5mya: australopethicus robustus (south africa)

(some think direct relation, others based on geography proximity)
(3.4mya evidence of butchering and bone breakage of stone tools)

pliocene time of adaptive radiation of hominins
there were multiple species of hominins living at the same time. 
ate different foods to coexist (like chimps and gorillas)

various proposed hominin phylogeny, however all generally have australopethicus anamensis as stem

latest DNA extraction is 1mya. so, unlikely for australopithecus

tool nomenclature:
* industry (style of make)
* hammerstone strikes core (raw material) to produce a flake. 
the flake is what is of use, as it will have a sharp edge
Could also whack core against anvil for same effect
* butchering place where carcasses butchered 
* quarrying where raw materials obtained

Oldawan industry oldest industry, with simple flake tools


human evolution (evolution radiation in Africa):
* energy efficiency: 
  bipedalism is more efficient than knuckle-walking
  better heat dissipation as being vertical blood flows from brain, less surface area to absorb radiation
* ecological:
  see over tall grass
* mating:
  charging to assert dominance
  males carry food to females
  (as females hide estrus, males stick around to ensure offspring)

-----------------------------------------
contention for brachiation/knuclkle-walking last locomotion for great apes LCA

if giving range, e.g. 7mya-6mya does this mean only relative dating possible?

early homo seems to have a longer femural neck?

if australopethicus first stone tool maker, how does this coincide with Stone Age dates?

things change, e.g. taphominic deformation from soil on bones

-------------------------------------------------

human and ape traits

procunsul no tail. ape molars

## chadensis 
APE
huge brow ridge.
small brain, reduced canine
U-shaped arcade

HUMAN
no honing complex, reduced prognthism
anteror foramen mahnum

lone femur is orrorin tugensis (not in spot test)

although robust hominin, not human ancestors

(all have molarised pre-molars, small anterior teeth)
eothipicus has largest saggital crest towards posterior
robustus least robust...only one which has nasal pillars (from south africa)

afarensis in tanzania also
larger anterior teeth than robustus

(generally smaller brain than robustus)
(both older than robusts, and more incisor prognathic and less dish-faced, 
i.e. sunken c-curve for nose)
afarensis has diastema. males have saggital crest
africanus more round nuchal crest, larger brain, less prognathic, smaller brow ridge
africanus has nasal pillars

stone tools 3.3million, so first used by afarensis

australopithecus have more U-shaped than apes

(asked about all robustus, afarensis and africanus)
