# Week 8 - The Genus Homo 
Pleistocene cyclic glaciation (glacial maxima when cold). 
As more water frozen on land (ice sheets), sea levels dropped 
(up to 120m:  Asia/North America; Australia/PNG <-Wallace's Line-> Mainland/South Asia connected;)
So, periods of drying and cooling. 
This promoted the reduction of forest lands, leading to savannah.
So, climate change greatly influenced Homo.
Larger home range, increase in diet quality, larger body size
Holocene 10,000 years ago. Not sure if just in an interglacial period starting 10,000 years ago.

A more derived trait means more human (as oppose to primitive)

Homo, 3rd molar smaller than 2nd molar?
Rounded brain case, reduced prognathic, smaller teeth, 
larger body (possibly due to increased meat diet through tool use)


Stone Tools:
1. 2.6mya-1.7mya: Oldowan
2. 1.7mya-200ka: Acheulean
3. 240ka-40ka: Levallois
3. 160ka-40ka: Mousterian

(from one large brow thickening in au. to distinct 2 pieces)
* 2.4-1.4mya: Homo habilis (Tanzania)
Although established, still bits and pieces before 2mya in terms of conclusive first-homo (bosei, garhi)
Oldowan tools (pre-Oldowan is australopithecines). just chopping, basic.
still had larger anterior teeth and U-shaped dental arcade compared to later Homo
saggital keel/torus rounded and no muscle attachments like crest 
big brow ridge
most likely scavengers
* 2.1-1.78mya: Homo rudolfensis (Kenya)
not conclusive if habilis and rudolfensis different species
* 335,000-236,000: Homo naledi (South Africa)
long curved thumbs, strong forearms

paleolithic; older (2.5mya - 250,000), middle (50,000), upper (12,000)

acheulean hand-axes, tear-drop shape

Homo confrontational (mostly small animals) and passive scavenging (hominin cut marks on top of carnivore cut marks on bone. have to fight off other scavengers)

torus is thickening of bone

* 1.8-0.05mya: Homo erectus (Nariokotome boy; first species leaving Africa: Georgia -> Indonesia (java) -> China (peking man))
(ruminations of true homo erectus in Europe, Spain. Spain is place of oldest European hominin)
Thick boned, saggital keel/torus, no chin.
Elongated skull (occipital and angular torus)
Pentagonal posterior shape (widest point lower than on modern humans)
Shovel shaped incisor (some people in Asia/Americas have this) for stronger enamel using teeth as tools
Longer lower limbs, reduced upper limbs
Short, broad pelvis. Symphsis narrow for bipedalism, therefore young born small heads and grow

Shovel shaped canines

Acheulean tool use (symmetry and intended design shows brain development)
However, some Erectus populations still used Oldowan (Asia)

Fur loss, more sweat glands, (lighter skin underneath fur like chimps. so evolved darker skin)
Much more carnivorous diet (smaller large intestine, larger small intestine, i.e. small gut as meat easier to digest), migratory, lowly dense populations
Leisure time as meat highly nutritous
Reason for venturing, to capture more animals and obtain more meat
* Possible difference to erectus 1.8-1.0mya: Homo ergaster (in Asia)
Ergaster seems to have more extended and lower cranial vault
* (-18,000) Homo Floresiensis (Flores, Indonesia). Hobbit. 
Insular dwarfism (small island with limited resources and no predators)
Descended from Erectus
Less progranthic, more of a chin, less extended than Erectus


Modern humans:
chin (unique), canine fossa (not present in early hominins), rounded/bulbous cranium, very large mastoid (is this because of better neck turning?), small teeth, gracile (no torus, keels, etc.)
cranial vault high (not low like in Homo Erectus)
flattish/square posterior cranium
chin, canine fossa, rounded/bulbous cranium, large mastoid, small teeth, huge forehead
widest posterior near top
Archaic homo sapiens:
called archaic as some believe they are just early homo sapiens and not distinct species
large supratorbital torus (2 distinct toruses above each eye, as oppose to one long in Erectus)

600,000-300,000: Homo heildedlbergensis (European archaic homo sapiens, Germany, Greece, Spain) -> 
The mid-facial prognathism makes them a possible ancestor to Neandanthals (and Denisovans, as more closely related to Neandanthals to Homo Sapiens)
Homo heildedlbergensis (europe) -> possible ancestor to neandanthals
Larger cranial vault to differentiate between Habilis
Homo rhodensis (africa)
Asian archiac homo sapiens (china, india).

Acheulean used until 150,000 years ago. Then Levallois (points and flakes)
Found near big game fossils. 
Archaic homo sapiens were big-game hunters
Confident had control of fire.
mousterian
(-40,000) Denisovan (russia, tibet)
(130,000 - 28,000): Neanderthal (belgium, middle east)
mid-facial prognathic due to swept back cheeks, no chin
low, extended cranial vault like erectus
mousterian (start of mesolithic). smaller, scraping meat off
massive bump at back of head and at top compared to Heilderbgensis (larger brain) (occipital bun)
widest near centre of cranial



(-40,000) Denisovan (russia, tibet)
from DNA in molar, finger, mandible
Melanisians have highest current DNA

(230,000 - 28,000): Neanderthal (northern europe, middle east, western asia)
mid-facial prognathic due to swept back cheeks and retromolar space, no chin, wide nose
oval shaped posterior cranial
shovel-shaped incisors (teeth as tools)
larger teeth than modern humans (taurodontism: expanded molar cavities)
tough, active lifestyle. barrel chested
red hair inherited from neandanthals?
neandanthal DNA in all of us, just less in Africans (movement back to Africa)
mousterian (middle stone age), however also used later stone age industries
no sewing tools, only animals skins and hides
migration due to climate change seen in neanderthals and homo sapiens
heavy meat reliance, capable hunters
cannibalism, burials
minimal indications of symbolic behaviour (animal teeth found as possible pendants)

Splitter view (out-of-africa; replacement model) is Homo Heidelbergensis as ancestor. 
So, we evolved from the archaic homo sapiens in Africa and later 'recolonised' 
other parts of the world.
mtDNA and Y-chromosome support African origin and leave of 100,000

Lumper view (multi-regional) has only late Homo Erectus


----------------------
how could neandethals and sapiens interbreed if different species?

constant reclassification ruminations, e.g. neandanthals in homo or subspecies of sapiens?
broad terminology with no conclusive results, e.g. archaic homo sapiens
