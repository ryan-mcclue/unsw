## Question 1
You might say things like "choose the two rods ... and ..., 
then weld them together to produce a new rod which we will call ...".


1.1 Construct min-heap O(n)
   add top of heap with min(left, right)
   remove top of heap O(logn)
   insert computed sum O(logn)

like huffman coding?: https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/112638/minimize-cost-of-recursive-pairwise-sums-how-to-prove-the-greedy-solution-works

1.2
construct red-black tree of pipes
side to add to is min(len(left), len(right))
compute current difference: d = (len(left) - len(right))
search for smallest pipe1 that is >= d and smallest pipe2 <= d
add min((pipe1 - d), (d - pipe2))

  \item Let $L$ and $R$ be the lengths of the left and right sides respectively.
        Let $O$ be an augmented array containing order of rods to weld and to what side.
  \item Construct a red-black tree of all rods $T$
  \item Determine imbalance $I = abs(L - R)$
  \item Find smallest rod $R_1$ such that $R_1 \geq I$ and largest rod $R_2$ such that $R_2 \leq I$ in $T$
  \item Determine rod to weld $R_3 = min(R_1 - I, I - R_2)$. Remove $R_3$ from $T$.
  \item Determine side to weld next rod $S = min(L, R)$
  \item Update either $L$ or $R$ with $R_3$ depending on $S$. Add pair $(R_3, S)$ to $O$
  \item Repeat extracting different $R_1$ and $R_2$ and inserting $R_3$ while $len(M) \geq 2$

## Question 2
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3438672/an-algorithm-to-find-every-induced-subgraph-that-is-a-tree

NOTE: graph can have multiple connected components

Induced subgraph can only delete vertices
2.1:
x is adjacent to 2 vertices.
if k=3, must be adjacent to at least 3 vertices

2.2:
(x, 2)
(j, 2)
(a, 2)

8 remaining vertices
(h, 4 - 1)
(b, 4 - 1)
(i, 3)
(c, 3)
(f, 3)
(d, 4)
(g, 4)
(e, 3)


2.3:
while True:
  vertex_edges = calculate_vertex_edges(M)

  if no_vertices_left:
    no_solution
  
  if (num_vertices - max_vertex_edge_count) < k:
    remove_vertex()
  elif min_vertex_edge_count < k:
    no_solution
  else:
    return vertices of vertex_edges



O(n)Â·(O(n^2) + O(n))
