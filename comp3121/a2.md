## Question 1
1.1 Construct min-heap O(n)
   add top of heap with min(left, right)
   remove top of heap O(logn)
   insert computed sum O(logn)

like huffman coding?: https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/112638/minimize-cost-of-recursive-pairwise-sums-how-to-prove-the-greedy-solution-works

1.2
construct red-black tree of pipes
side to add to is min(len(left), len(right))
compute current difference: d = (len(left) - len(right))
search for smallest pipe1 that is >= d and smallest pipe2 <= d
add min((pipe1 - d), (d - pipe2))

## Question 2
2.1:
x is adjacent to 2 vertices.
if k=3, must be adjacent to at least 3 vertices

2.2:
(x, 2)
(j, 2)

8 remaining vertices
(h, 4)
(b, 4)
(i, 3)
(c, 3)
(f, 3)
(d, 4)
(g, 4)
(e, 3)

2.3:
for each vertex calculate how many edges O(n)

iterate k until max value of k is floor(n/2)
  for each vertex, remove if edge count < k; update remaining
  if





every vertex >= k edges (such that len(vertices) - edge_count >= k)
