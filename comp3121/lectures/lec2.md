multiplication of polynomials faster than large numbers? (don't need as many large integer multiplications, as are computing coefficients)
multiplying two polynomials of degree 2 gives degree 4
splitting into 3 sections with polynomials faster than Karatsuba

although asymoptotically faster slicing into smaller pieces, constants (i.e. coefficients) grow very fast, e.g. 1million·n or 10^8·n etc.
so, most always know what constants are. 
not enough to just look at asymptotic to say faster than another

TODO: warden puzzle write-up

eigenvector used to google page rank algorithm?

## Greedy Method (lots of combinatorial problems?)
