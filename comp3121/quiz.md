Include diagrams as long as accompanied by written explanation.

A non-trivial example is essentially one with more than one value - you should try to include at least 3 values in the heap.

You can include pseudocode as a supplement to an otherwise complete response, but it is never necessary to do so.

You may wish to have separate sections for the algorithm, proof and time complexity, or you could combine them; and you may wish to describe your algorithm in paragraphs, dot points/numbered lists, or a mix of both.
