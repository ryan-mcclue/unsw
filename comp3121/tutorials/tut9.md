Convert a decision problem by adding an argument to the function,
e.g. f(graph, source, sink, min-cut-test)

min-cut is dual of max-flow

As problem can be polynomially reduced to other problem that is in P, it's in P

so every NP problem can be transformed into a NP-hard problem in polynomial time?

every problem turned into NP-hard
