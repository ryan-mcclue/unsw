TODO: glitching in ripple adder as carries propagate
clock solves this; however what order of time is the glitch?
i.e. what is fastest concievable clock speed?
   (would look at period on oscillscope channel)

TODO: the difference between the two RTLs from lab2 is that using '+' FPGA uses built in hardware?
i.e. bypasses a LUT?

TODO: are Q' outputs often ignored?

TODO: when would level-edge be preferred if inherent glitching?

TODO: why is converting a truth table to a mux really that useful? 
      just as a human understanding, not circuit efficiency?
      For example, does synthesis do Karnaugh map or Shannon's?

TODO: would all encoders be priority encoders as more efficient to just look at one 1 bit
