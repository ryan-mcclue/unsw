TODO: glitching in ripple adder as carries propagate
clock solves this; however what order of time is the glitch?
i.e. what is fastest concievable clock speed?
   (would look at period on oscillscope channel)

TODO: the difference between the two RTLs from lab2 is that using '+' FPGA uses built in hardware?
i.e. bypasses a LUT?

TODO: are Q' outputs often ignored?

TODO: when would level-edge be preferred if inherent glitching?
