This is for a university course with outline:
This course aims to provide students with a knowledge of designing and implementing simple digital logic circuits & systems. The basic building blocks of combinational and sequential circuits are introduced to enable students to develop circuit solutions to problems and to understand the design and operation of hardware models of digital systems. Students are introduced to the VHDL hardware description language as a means of describing circuits. Computer-aided design tools are used to specify, simulate and implement a variety of simple digital systems. Students learn how to implement and test their designs using Field-Programmmable Gate Arrays.
