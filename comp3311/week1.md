DBMS for efficient concurrent manipulation of large amounts of data using set theory and constraints
Queries converted to relational algebra which is built upon set theory, e.g. a table/relation is a set of tuples/rows
So relational algebra machine code for psql

SQL standard is language for managing relational DBMS. Postgresql documentation explicit in standard conformance.
Could also have noSQL or time-series (i.e. optimised for time-based queries, i.e. index of data determines efficiency) 

sqlite3 serverless

**Procedural**
`cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Ryan'))`
**Declarative**
`session.add(user)`

Data model, e.g Book entity with attribute title and many-to-many relationship
Relational schema would specify primary/foreign keys
