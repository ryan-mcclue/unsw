Constraints largely refer to uniqueness, e.g. key, unique, referential

A foreign key can be null and duplicate

## SQL Modelling
Effectively '1' will have foreign key, 'n' will be modelled by relationship table
* 1:1 
  could have two tables each with foreign key referencing other primary key
  however redudancy comes up, only requiring one foreign key for one of them (as can access other through them)
  what side foreign key is one depends on participation
* 1:n
  '1' side with foreign key only
* n:m (cannot create n:m with total participation in sql)
  create new relationship table, i.e. no attributes in host tables

A foreign key can have multiple attributes.
Can also have multiple foreign keys.

Composite attribute can be mapped to multiple separate attributes or a separate table
Superclass  could be multiple tables with foreign keys or single table with nulls.
Multivalued attribute in standard sql would have it as it a separate table. However extensions allow for arrays

Cyclical references solved by building table incrementally using `alter table`

Weak entity will have its primary key the foreign key of strong entity

Going from ER diagram -> relational model (e.g. no multi-valued attributes) -> schema; lose expressiveness

## Populating Database
`insert into table(order2, order1) values (x, y), (a, b)`
(using `serial`::integer will allow for leaving out primary key and have it autogenerated)
`update sells set price = price * 1.1;`
`delete from drinkers where addr='Randwick' cascade;`

\pset null NUL (pset for printing settings)

inserting with `copy` will fail if any of the tuples are invalid (unlike `insert`)

`pg_dump -O -x db > db.dump`
