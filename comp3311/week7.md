relational design theory aims to minimise stored data by utilising functional dependencies, i.e. relationships between attributes in a relation
normalisation method would transform schema to remove identified redundancy (non-deterministic however, so multiple ways to acheive)
normalisation involves decomposition on functional dependecies, i.e break into smaller tables

if multiple tuples contain the same attribute X and attribute Y is same, then Y functionally dependent on X
