## Fundamentals

* Hosts: any device that sends or recieves traffic
  - client: initiates
  - server: respond
* IP Address: identifies each host
  - IPv4, 32bits, 4 octets
  - Assigned hierarchically, e.g. Ry, Inc. 10.x.x.x (broken up into hierarchies via subnetting, i.e. subnet of Ry, Inc IP space)
* Network: connection of hosts. share IP address space
  - purpose is to share information
  - in reality, a logical grouping of hosts with similar connectivity
  - can have network within another network, i.e. a subnet
* Repeater: regenerates signal so can span large distances as signal decays (do routers have this in them?)
* Hub: multi-port repeater. Everyone recieves everyone's data
* Bridge: sits between two hubs. can contain traffic to one side
* Switch: hub + bridge. facilitates communication within a network
* Router: facilitate connection between networks. traffic control point (security, filtering, etc.)
  - knowledge of other networks is a route stored in routing table
  - IP address of router is gateway as it serves as host's way out of network
  a host will have a default gateway, which is a particular interface IP address of a router (router can have multiple interface IP addresses)
  - enables network hierarchies
* OSI (just a model to conceptualise, not rigid. e.g. router that has Access Control List will look at L4 header):
  - layer of rules that govern network communication
   L1: Physical (transport bits). ethernet, wifi, bluetooth
   L2: Data (hop-to-hop; places and retrieves bits). From one NIC to another NIC
   Each NIC uses MAC addressing scheme, 48bits, 12 hex digits
   Switches also L2 technology
   Every hop, the L2 header of the packet is changed to point to another router's MAC 
   L3: Network (end-to-end). Uses IP addressing scheme. Routers, hosts (anything with an IP address)
   ARP links L3 address to L2 address
   L4: Transport (service-to-service). Distinguish data streams
   Port addressing scheme. TCP, UDP
   Clients will randomly choose port (allows multiple connections to same server), while server will use well known
   L5: (session), L6: (presentation), L7: (application). 
   Merge all into Application. The application can perform these 3 layers in any way it wants.
* Encapsulation: (((data + L4 header)segment + L3 header)packet + L2 header)frame
i.e. L3 header and its data is known as packet, L2 header and its data is known as frame, etc.
* De-encapsulation: will iteratively strip away headers if matches 
i.e. checks L3 header and sees it matches, so moves up to L2

IMPORTANT:
  - switching is process of moving data within network
  - routing is process of moving data between networks
  - many network devices exists, yet these are the fundamental operations they could perform

• Internet is a complex global infrastructure
• What are the organising principles behind the Internet?
• What really happens when you “browse the Web”?
• What are TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, NAT, VPNs, 802.11,.... anyway?
• What issue you need to take into consideration to make a
computer network work well?
• What design strategies have proven valuable?
• How do we evaluate network performance?

network speed faster if closer to the ISPs switching network

network edge: hosts/end systems (run networked apps that provide services), access network (edge routers connecting to ISPs network core), physical media
network core: packet switching (breaks into packets of header+payload ∴ each packet independent), i.e. routers, switches (imagine an ISP network is interconnected routers)
legacy circuit switching dedicates resources (not appropriate for bursty, variable data rate connections on the Internet. furthermore, not as economical as can't allow more users than hardware permits)
main functions:
1. packet forwarding (input to output)
2. packet routing (routing algorithm, i.e. path determination based on header)
we assume store-and-forward switching, i.e. router takes header and payload before transmitting 
packet switching utilises statistical multiplexing, i.e. educated assumption of bursty traffic
if queue overloaded, packets go into buffer (transient overload) resulting in a delay
if buffer excedded (persistent overload), packets dropped
as a result, packet switching requires protocols to ensure reliable data transfer and congestion control

performance: loss, delay, throughput 

so your home network is a type of access network, as well as connection to ISP? (i.e. access network just network to a router that goes to the ISP)
however, you have access ISPs that are interconnected via a global ISP 
(Telstra probably a Tier-1 ISP as would provide international coverage?)
access networks:
* WLAN (wifi?)
* WAN (wide area network; cellular)
* Enterprise networks (mail servers, switches in hardware etc.)

Internet Structure (with IXPs intermingled between some junctions to connect ISPs together):
1. Tier 1 ISP / CDN
2. Regional ISP
3. Access ISP

UNSW ISP is AARNET?

Delays:
1. Processing (determine errors)
2. Queueing (packets_arriving x packet_length / link_bandwidth(is this transmission rate?))
3. Transmission (time to place a bit on the wire, e.g. packet_length / transmission_rate_10Mbps)
4. Propagation

coaxial cables used in copper transmission lines (inner conductor surrounded by shield).
ethernet twisted pair wires to reduce interference
fibre optic glass carries light

so network core are just ISPs interconnected routers?

the router+modem will go to the headend or central office?

connect end systems to edge routers via access network:
* DSL (phone line). ADSL referring to asynchronous upstream/downstream transmission rates (half-duplex means send or recieve at one time)
* HFC (hybrid fibre coax)
* Fibre optic

IETF and RFC govern a lot of Internet standards

* network edge includes communication links like fibre optic?
* distinction between a protocol like TCP and a game protocol?
* distinction between WAN/LAN. just size?
what about LPWAN?
* difference between cable headend and central office?
* hierarchy:topology
p2p:(mesh, bus)
client-server:star
So, WAN vs Mesh? (perhaps WAN is another distinction like size? would probably have another like radio technology e.g. cellular/wifi etc.)
* what is net neutrality? (Computerphile, Dr Richard Mortier networking)
* traceroute gaps? why delays decrease as going down?

In practice, end-to-end throughput bottleneck is that which exists in network edge

stochastic means random distribution but may still be analysed with statistics, e.g. stock market graphs

bernoulli trial is binomial experiment whereby probability stays the same across repetitions
binomial question: probability of 'x' successes in 'n' trials?
calculate number of ways to acheive said number and multiply by probability
number of ways is: N choose X

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$(ping) generates RTT, not end-to-end/latency delay. operates under ICMP (diagnose network issues)
generally just to establish connection

$(traceroute) identify hop locations
exploits TTL field in IP packet header. TTL is decremented each router it passes through, i.e. each hop
most routers are configured to return an ICMP time exceeded message when TTL=0.
some routers are configured to block this ICMP response
sends out UDP
* do all routers have to have publically acessible IP addresses? concept of a private IP?

SSH is a secure protocol on top of TCP 

$(ifconfig) lists network interfaces (software connection to network card, e.g. virbr0, wlp6s0)

$(netstat -i) list interfaces and thier MTU, flags (e.g. promiscious mode, running etc.)
$(netstat -r) displays kernel routing table
* what are 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.0

$(netperf) measures throughput

$(dig) ip⟷  host-name by contacting DNS servers 

$(wireshark) captures all link-level (ethernet) frames
