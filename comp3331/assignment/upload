I have a program that implements a command prompt menu:
```
char username[32] = {0};
printf("Username: ");
fgets(username, sizeof(username), stdin);
username[strcspn(username, "\n")] = '\0';

char password[32] = {0};
printf("Password: ");
fgets(password, sizeof(password), stdin);
password[strcspn(password, "\n")] = '\0';

// send username and password to server and verify
// ...

while (true)
{
  char command_buffer[1024] = {0};

  printf("Enter one of the following commands (EDG, UED, SCS, DTE, AED, UVF, OUT): ");
  fgets(command_buffer, sizeof(command_buffer), stdin);
  command_buffer[strcspn(command_buffer, "\n")] = '\0';

  Tokens tokens = split_into_tokens(command_buffer);
  if (tokens.num_tokens > 0)
  {
    char *command_name = tokens.tokens[0];

    if (strcmp(command_name, "EDG") == 0)
    {
            process_edg_command(&tokens);
    }
    // etc.
  }
}
```
I want to pass in the username and password automatically, so I do this:
```
```
However, after the input is passed in is processed, it just continually prints out the phrase ``. This to me suggests that so input is being constantly feed to the program, like a single enter key.a
