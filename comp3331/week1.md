• Internet is a complex global infrastructure
• What are the organising principles behind the Internet?
• What really happens when you “browse the Web”?
• What are TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, NAT, VPNs, 802.11,.... anyway? (define format and order)
• What issue you need to take into consideration to make a
computer network work well?
• What design strategies have proven valuable?
• How do we evaluate network performance?

network edge: hosts/end systems (run networked apps that provide services), access network (edge routers connecting to ISPs network core), physical media
network core: packet switching, i.e. routers, switches (imagine an ISP network is largely routers)
performance: loss, delay, throughput 

so your home network is a type of access network, as well as connection to ISP?

so network core are just ISPs interconnected routers?

connect end systems to edge routers via access network:
* DSL (phone line). ADSL referring to asynchronous upstream/downstream transmission rates
* HFC (hybrid fibre coax)
* Fibre optic

coaxial cables used in transmission lines (inner conductor surrounded by shield).
different to fibre optic

IETF and RFC govern a lot of Internet standards

* network edge includes communication links like fibre optic?
* distinction between a protocol like TCP and a game protocol?
* distinction between WAN/LAN. just size?
what about LPWAN?
* hierarchy:topology
p2p:(mesh, bus)
client-server:star
So, WAN vs Mesh?
