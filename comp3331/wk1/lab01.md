## 1. Nslookup

1. The domain `www.koala.com.au` has 2 IP addresses: `104.21.45.210` and `172.67.219.46`
In my opinion, the reason for having several IP addresses as an output is for load balancing reasons. Specifically, there are several webservers for the domain to allow traffic be distributed across multiple resources.

2. The IP address `127.0.0.1` is also known as localhost or the loopback device.
It's purpose is to provide an interface that allows a host to interact with its own network services

## 2. Ping

On my own machine not connected to the CSE network:

* kremlin ip resolved, no packets returned
* only know last because of googling IP. however last known has .unsw
* cross pacific only because of googling not RTT
