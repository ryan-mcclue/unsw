SDN (software defined networking) uses software over say hardware routers/switches
* Cloud applications could not function without this?
(essentially moves control plane to software, actual data plane the forwards packets is still hardware)

Wireless network will have a base station that is typically connected to a wired network, e.g. cell tower, 802.11 nomenclature is access point
The wireless link, connecting nodes to the base station involves multiple access protocols

The higher the frequency of radio wave, the more permeable it is

Wireless ad-hoc mode (as opposed to infrastructure) allows devices to communicate with one another without a router, i.e. no base station
Devices within link coverage route amongst themselves

The signal attenuation (multi-path effects) from physical objects, other RF (other nodes) and distance make wireless more involved then wired

Specific wireless link implementations would be digital modulation techniques such as binary phase shift keying 

802.11 uses CSMA/CA for multiple access
