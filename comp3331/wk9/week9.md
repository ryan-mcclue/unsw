link layer technology underpin LANs, as devices in a LAN will typically share same channel, e.g. 6 node LAN

link layer occurences localised to subnet

link layer connect adajacent nodes via wireless (ethernet) or wired (WiFi, 4G, satellite) via framing (adding header and trailer bytes)

each link protocol provides different services, e.g. ethernet low bit error link so reliability typically only used in WiFi
(half-duplex, error detection, error correction, flow control, etc.)
TODO(Ryan): Why both link-level and end-end reliability (some form of bit checking in UDP/IP/Ethernet)?
(is it because to say transport checksum only on its headers, so not all encompassing?)

link layer implemented by NIC

parity bits (even or odd number of 1s) form of error detection in link layer (as oppose to checksums used by higher layers)
in practice bit errors in bursts, so parity not that useful.
âˆ´, CRC is widely used (which performs a more computational intensive operation, i.e. division and check if remainder is 0)

wireless is broadcast (share medium/link)
ethernet can be point-to-point or broadcast

broadcast implies multiple access-network, meaning nodes could simultaneously transmit can cause a collision
so, multiple access protocols exist to determine how to best share channel (part of link layer protocol)
various categories:
* Channel Partitioning (divide into slots. not decentralised):
share channel efficiently at high load
  - TDMA (each node gets fixed length slot dependent on transmission time)
  - FDMA (slots divided into frequency bands)
* Random Access (collisions allowed, recover from them. with a collision, entire packet transmission time wasted): 
share channel efficiently at low load
  - ALOHA (transmit at full channel data rate). very poor efficiency
  - CSMA (carrier sense multiple access). listen before transmitting (collision still occur due to delays)
  - CSMA/CD (collision detection). if detects another transmission while sending, abort. good efficiency
  (ethernet, WiFi)
* Taking Turns (nodes with more to send take longer turns):
  - Polling (captain node invites other nodes to transmit in turn) 
  - Token passing (central token passed sequentially to nodes)
  (bluetooth, fddi (fibre optic LAN))
