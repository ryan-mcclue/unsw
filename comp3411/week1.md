Turing test is a human interacts with another human and computer and can't tell whos who; If passed, not earthshattering.
A Turing machine has strip of paper with 1/0s, arrow pointing to 1/0s, can switch number and move left/right based on rules.
HTML is not Turing complete as cannot change state of system.

AI is performing reasoning on knowledge.
This may involve looking at past information, looking at a predefined goal etc. 

An agent senses information and acts upon it, ideally to maximise performance.
PEAS:
 - Performance: +1000 if gold, -1000 eaten
 - Environment: 4x4 grid, player/pit/wumpus locations
 - Actuators: Left/right/forward/back/shoot
 - Sensors: Breeze/stench 

Environment/task type influences agent design:

Simulated (computer program)                                        | Situated (interacts directly with world) and Embodied (physical body)
Static (environment not changing as thinking)                       | Dynamic
Discrete (finite number of moves)                                   | Continuous
Observable (can see all pieces)                                     | Partially Observable
Deterministic                                                       | Stochastic
Sequential (evaluate based on sequence of actions, i.e. plan ahead) | Sequential
Known (rules known)                                                 | Known
