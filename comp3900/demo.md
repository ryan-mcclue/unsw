record ourselves presenting in lab (does not have to include QA)
must be <12minutes (quality over quantity)

IMPORTANT: throughout demo talk about users
IMPORTANT: don't show code 
(however jupyter notebook is ok. 
can convert it to slides for presentation however.
focus on highlighting outputs)
IMPORTANT: demo to client separately after. 
           get them to send email feedback to tutor in format:
        - Progress made so far:
        - Depth of research/domain knowledge:
        - Design and relevence to user:
        - Additional comments:

content non technical; answer:
  - Why are you building product

One section each for 
  - want went well
  - what didn't
  - ways to improve/things to try next sprint
  e.g. lacking clear acceptance criteria, design docs, regular meetings, lack of discussion with other members etc.
