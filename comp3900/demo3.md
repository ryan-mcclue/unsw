TODO: 
 - new demo for client and collect feedback
 - Plan for the Team work and Collaboration assessment (to be presented in W9)
 - sprint3 mainly of software quality?

Software Quality:
  - must be dockerised
  - clean interface
  - user friendly
  - remove debugging features (e.g. printing to stdout, plaintext API keys)
  - code style, e.g. pythonic linting code, code documentation comments
  - good use of code algorithms
  - code cohesion 
  - testing and coverage clear in README
