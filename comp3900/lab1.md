how many sprints? (create tickets specific to sprint at start of sprint?)
how many standups within sprints?

say have 3 sprints. weekly standups?
TODO: when to create tickets? at sprint?
TODO: - have sprints end on a lab date
      - standup will be conducted in say ms teams
        have members say what they have done, what they plan to do and what blockers have
        will record meeting minutes as markdown files on git repo
        a standup will update tickets

You should ensure that Jira is kept up to date and that you are making good use of its features,
use git for managing your codebase and follow good git practices
make sure that you are fostering collaboration with good internal
documentation, meeting minutes, or similar.

For Jira specifically, we will look at reports generated on Jira and your Jira workflow
to assess evidence of standups, consistent use of Jira throughout the term, the
sprint feature being used, acceptance criteria listed within each user story ticket,
and current status for all tickets (completed tickets should be marked as Done).
