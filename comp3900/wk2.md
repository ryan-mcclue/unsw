    Confirmation email is sent after registration.
Probable-Effort: high
* backlog/technical-work:

SCRUM MASTER facilitates scrum events

Scrum events are time-boxed and non-negotiable dates:
* Sprints (2-4 weeks; releasable product)
  1. Sprint Planning:
    Develop sprint goal/backlog, i.e. collection of tasks from product backlog to do
    IMPORTANT: jira for sprint backlog to-do, in-progress, done
  TODO: required to have daily scrum for assignment marking?
  2. Daily Scrum:
     - What did I do yesterday that helped the development team meet the Sprint Goal?
     - What will I do today to help the development team meet the Sprint Goal?
     - do I see any obstacles that prevent me or the Dev team to meeting the Sprint Goal?
  3. Work:
    Update sprint backlog. If new feature, add to product backlog (however can modify/combine tasks)
  4. Review:
    Revise product backlog
  5. Retrospective:
    What went well, what didn't. Possibly add these product backlog
    TODO: should add at least one improvement task to backlog for next sprint

Historical:
Burndown chart tracks amount of estimated effort remaining in sprint
Velocity chart tracks how much work done per sprint
