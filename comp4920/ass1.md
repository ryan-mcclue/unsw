Sartre calls “bad faith”: making things
easier for yourself by pretending that you have no choice, when really there are
always options open to you 

pg. 89:
indeed, the critics of
Hume’s view will claim that it is too simple for some of the acknowledged facts about
human beings, and that it is based in a reductive view of how human beings act

pg. 104:
This might lead on to a criticism of virtue ethics: that it
cannot be a comprehensive moral theory because it cannot provide us with
proper answers to the many moral questions in which rights play an important
role

pg. 107:
 On McDowell’s view, “flourishing”
is not itself a substantive idea

- answered the question(s) with reasons
- articulated objections to reasons and responses to these
- specifically cite course material to support points being made
- cite external literature also?

Daily life continues to involve more technologies.
As a result, there are far-reaching societal impacts to consider when creating computer science ethical guidelines based on act versus rule utilitarianism.
By considering leadership challenges relating to data obtainment, technology misuse and user freedom,
it can be seen that rule utilitarianism is more desirable.
It allows for the creation of guidelines that are both beneficial to society and simple for a governing body to implement.

Under rule utilitarianism, ethical guidelines for data retrieval can be made consistent.
This promotes societal confidence in the computer science profession, leading to a happier society.
Github copilot (ref.) is an AI code completion tool that is trained on public code repositories.
The concept of data retrieval can infringe on rights.

Considering act utilitarianism, would allow as benefits more people to use techonology with less skill.
however, this is self-defeating because it would make it impossible to have social customs like trust in computer science to not steal your data and have someone use it.
- self-defeating because it would make it impossible to have social customs (like promising) 
Under rule utilitarianism, do ...

Whilst this does have the possible drawback of ...


obtainment of data to train (github copilot)
act: as benefits more people to use techonology with less skill, do it 
rule: don't force creators to have their data be used for training; be explicit about it

"show is simply that it is not optimal always to follow the rule"

misuse of technology (generative AI audio deepfakes)
 - cumbersome method (e.g. ok if person can no longer talk etc.)

value users freedom (intel sgx),
 - immoral results


rule:
consistency (build trust as all computer scientists follow same principles),
scalability (technology continues to grow and touch many aspects of life),
simplicity (governing bodies to enforce)
