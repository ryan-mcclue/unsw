As computer science technologies continue to become more involved in daily life,
the consequences of creating ethical guidelines based on act versus rule utilitarianism are far reaching.
By considering leadership challenges relating to data obtainment, technology misuse and user freedom,
it can be seen that rule utilitarianism is more desirable.
It results in professional guidelines that are consistent, scalable and simple for a governing computer science body to implement.

Under rule utilitarianism, guidelines relating to the retrieval of user data can be made
consistent, maximising trust in society.
Looking at the github copilot that
Consider the situation of github copilot, that harvest users code to train model.

obtainment of data to train (github copilot)
act: as benefits more people to use techonology with less skill, do it 
rule: don't force creators to have their data be used for training; be explicit about it

misuse of technology (generative AI audio deepfakes)

value users freedom (intel sgx),


rule:
consistency (build trust as all computer scientists follow same principles),
scalability (technology continues to grow and touch many aspects of life),
simplicity (governing bodies to enforce)
