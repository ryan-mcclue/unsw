Indeed automated decision making in health sciences poses many more risks

cost of training excludes others from doing so
access to training data excludes others

HEALTHCARE:

IMPORTANT: in effect AI predictors; try to catch things missed by traditional healthcare process
1. detecting heart arrhythmiams (AliveCor KardiaMobile analyser)
2. monitor patient vitals to detect sepsis (hcahealthcare sepsis prediction)
3. siezure detection (embrace2 bracelet)
4. skin checking (apps)
5. stroke detection (lov app)
6. breast cancer detection

Perhaps best to combine deep learning predictions with clinicians diagnosis improve patient outcome

- AI-powered diagnosis

Natural Language Processing for electronic health records
- AI-assisted robotic surgery
Predictive analytics for patient outcomes
- AI-driven drug discovery
- Virtual nursing assistants
AI for personalized treatment plans


AI technology:
  Description:
    - Purpose/goals,
    - Scope (context, time, location, use case), 
    - Needs (motivation, reasons for creation), 
    - Benefits (health/economic/societal)

  Users:
    - attributes (age group, gender etc.)
    - needs (when iteracting with tech.)
    - skills

  Stakeholders (somone who is positively/negatively impacted by tech):
    - attributes (age group, gender etc.)
    - needs (when iteracting with tech.)
    - skills

1.
Of 3 users/stakeholders, discuss tech impact on their ethical principles/concerns:
ethical principles of fairness, privacy and security, reliability and safety, trans-
parency, inclusion, and accountability
learn about existing efforts to mitigate these issues.
TODO: backup stakeholder discussion with research?
TODO: discuss frictions across different stakeholders
TODO: summarise findings in chart? 
(radar chart for overlap and grouped bar chart for the degree to which affect them)

2.
Of a similar technology, discuss impact on two previously discussed ethical issues.
TODO: use table/chart again
(stacked bar chart to show how much ethical principles of each compare)

TODO: describe what possible impacts this tech might have based on previous tech
discuss possible mitigation techniques backed by data

5.
Compare/summarise findings of 1. with that of 2.
what do they agree on? etc.

6.
Provide recommendation to adopt technology and possible changes to it.
