AI technology:
1.
- Describe the technology, 
  the purpose/goals,
  the scope (context, time, location, use case), 
  the needs (motivation, reasons for creation), 
  and the benefits (health/economic/societal)

2.
- Users:
attributes (age group, gender etc.), needs (when iteracting with tech.), skills
- Stakeholder (somone who is positively/negatively impacted by tech):
attributes (age group, gender etc.), needs (when iteracting with tech.), skills

3.
Of 3 users/stakeholders, discuss tech impact on their ethical principles/concerns:
ethical principles of fairness, privacy and security, reliability and safety, trans-
parency, inclusion, and accountability
learn about existing efforts to mitigate these issues.
TODO: backup stakeholder discussion with research?
TODO: discuss frictions across different stakeholders
TODO: summarise findings in chart?

4.
Of similar technologies, discuss impact on two previously discussed ethical issues.
TODO: use table/chart again
TODO: describe what possible impacts this tech might have based on previous tech
discuss possible mitigation techniques backed by data

5.
Compare/summarise findings of 4. with that of 3.
what do they agree on? etc.

6.
Provide recommendation to adopt technology and possible changes to it.
