# KardiaMobile 6L: Advanced Personal ECG Technology

Description:
KardiaMobile 6L is a personal ECG (Electrocardiogram) device that leverages AI to create a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for personal heart health monitoring. 

Purpose:
Facilitate the early detection of heart rhythm abnormalities, thereby reducing the negative impact of heart disease in the community.
  
Objectives:
1. Comphrehensive Monitoring:
   Record electrical heart signals from six locations (leads I, II, III, aVL, aVR, and aVF).
   Capture a more detailed view of heart rhythm compared to traditional ECG wearables like smartwatches.
   Enable detection of a wider range of heart conditions than single or dual-lead devices.
2. Accurate:
   Utilise AI algorithms to perform on-the-spot advanced ECG analysis.
   Detect and classify up to 6 types of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation.
3. Adaptable:
   Employ AI to analyse historical data and establish personalised heart health trends.
   Identify potential trigger points specific to an individual's heart rhythm changes.
   Assist in early detection of gradual changes in heart health that may require medical attention.
4. Accessible:
   Easy to use by the average person without medical training.
   Provide results that are meaningful to both consumers and healthcare professionals.
   Enable easy recording and saving of accurate heart data directly on a smartphone.
   Facilitate seamless sharing of ECG data with healthcare providers.

Scope:
  Time Frame:
    Provides a detailed analysis in a 30 second window, allowing for immediate on-the-spot readings.
    Saves previous reports for cumulative analysis and trend identification, supporting routine monitoring.
  Location:
    Primary use in a relaxed home setting.
    Portable design allows for use in other locations such as a hospital or health clinic.
    Potential for integration in telemedicine and remote patient monitoring programs.
  Primary Use Case:
    Facilitate regular heart monitoring at home for individuals with known heart conditions.
    Enable sharing of data with healthcare providers such as cardiologists or GPs for informed decision-making.
  Secondary Use Cases:
    Preventive monitoring for individuals with a family history of heart disease.
    Stress-related heart rhythm monitoring in high-pressure work environments
    Regular check-ups for health-conscious individuals.
