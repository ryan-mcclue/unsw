# KardiaMobile 6L: Advanced Personal ECG Technology

## 1. Purpose
Purpose:
KardiaMobile 6L leverages AI to create a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for personal heart health monitoring. 
It aims to facilitate the early detection of heart rhythm abnormalities, thereby reducing the negative impact of heart disease in the community.
By combining advanced ECG (Electrocardiogram) technology with AI analysis, KardiaMobile 6L bridges the gap between consumer health devices and professional medical equipment.
  
Objectives:
1. Comphrehensive Monitoring:
   Record electrical heart signals from six locations (leads I, II, III, aVL, aVR, and aVF).
   Capture a more detailed view of heart rhythm compared to traditional ECG wearables like smartwatches.
   Enable detection of a wider range of heart conditions than single or dual-lead devices.
2. Accurate:
   Utilise AI algorithms to perform on-the-spot advanced ECG analysis.
   Detect and classify up to 6 types of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation.
3. Adaptable:
   Employ AI to analyse historical data and establish personalised heart health trends.
   Identify potential trigger points specific to an individual's heart rhythm changes.
   Assist in early detection of gradual changes in heart health that may require medical attention.
4. Accessible:
   Easy to use by the average person without medical training.
   Provide results that are meaningful to both consumers and healthcare professionals.
   Enable easy recording and saving of accurate heart data directly on a smartphone.
   Facilitate seamless sharing of ECG data with healthcare providers.

Scope:
  Time:
    KardiaMobile 6L provides a detailed analysis in a 30second window.
    This allows for immediate on the spot readings.
    Previous reports are saved so that trend analysis can be performed with repeated use.
    Therefore, suitable for routine monitoring and on-demand use during symptomatic heart episodes.
  Location:
Primary use in a relaxed home setting, promoting regular self-monitoring
Portable design allows for use in various locations:

On-the-go for active individuals
In office settings for quick check-ups
In clinical settings as a supplementary tool for healthcare providers

Potential for integration in telemedicine and remote patient monitoring programs

    The primary location in which KardiaMobile 6L is used is in a relaxed home setting. 
    However, due to it's portability and advanced capabilities, there is also potential use in other locations such as a hospital or health clinic.
  Use Case:
Primary Use Case:

Facilitate regular heart monitoring at home for individuals with known heart conditions
Use AI to make determinations regarding heart health and convey information to the user
Enable sharing of data with healthcare providers (e.g., cardiologists, GPs) for informed decision-making

Secondary Use Cases:

Preventive monitoring for individuals with a family history of heart disease
Regular check-ups for health-conscious individuals
Athletic performance monitoring for sports enthusiasts
Stress-related heart rhythm monitoring in high-pressure work environments


Healthcare Professional Use:

Supplement in-clinic ECG readings with patient's at-home data
Monitor patients' heart health between appointments
Assess the effectiveness of treatments or medications on heart rhythms over time



   The primary use case of KardiaMobile 6L is to facilitate regular heart monitoring at home for individuals with known heart conditions.
   Using AI, determinations are made regarding heart and conveyed to the user.
   This information can then shared with a healthcare provider such as a cardiologist or GP to 
KardiaMobile 6L helps you (and your doctor) collect more heart data and better understand your heart activity.

   However, people with a family history of heart disease or health conscious individuals can also benefit from KardiaMobile 6L.
