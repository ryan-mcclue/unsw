Have performed value-sensitive design on KardiaMobile.
Complete/refine the MITIGATE section and JUDGEMENT section.

Then summarise the discussions and findings on the ethical dilemmas in a chart or a table.


Rating: 5 
Principle: Privacy & security 
Stakeholder: Jake Miller(nurse) 
As a nurse using this device, I think that privacy & security is important to users. Since I use this device everyday in the hospital to track patient heart rates a lot of data is being stored and patients are asking how their data is stored and is it safe. But from past experiences, I have found that there are options to opt in and opt out for data being collected and stored in the cloud.  
As a nurse using this device, I think that privacy & security is important to users. Since I use this device every day to track patients heart rates, a lot of data is being collected and stored. I have also found that patients are regularly asking how this information is stored and whether it is secure. But from past experiences, I have found that there are options to opt in and opt out for data being collected and stored in the cloud. In addition to this, the data is stored on secure government severs.  

Rating: 3 
Principle: Reliability 
Stakeholder: Joanna Chia (cardiologist) 
The KadriaMobile ECG is good as 6 lead ECG, that offers patients peace of mind about their cardiovascular health from the comforts of their own home. That being said, it is not as effective as a medically administered 12 lead ECG and can be prone to errors. I would recommend if patients have serious concerns they should come in and seek medical advice from a trained professional. 

Rating: 1 Star 
Principle: Inclusion 
Stakeholder: John Moorbank 
I had a stroke a few years back and have been unable to fully regain my fine motor skills since then. Due to this, I find it difficult to pick up and hold the Kardia 6L due to its small and flat profile. It also requires a lot of concentration for me to be able to touch it to my left leg whilst holding the rest of the leads in the right spot. Also, I had to use my son’s old iPhone in order to use the app with the Kardia since my Nokia isn’t compatible. 

Rating: 3 
Principle: Transparency 
Stakeholder: Suresh Akhash (Investor)
I have mixed feelings regarding company’s transparency practices.  
On the positive side, I receive detailed quarterly financial reports and am made aware of new high level technical specifications of the device. 
However, there is limited information pertaining to user retention metrics and regional performance breakdowns, subscription models.
I would also like more information regarding the specifics of the AI algorithm to assess the long-term viability of my investment. 
Balancing transparency with proprietary 

DISCUSSION: 

1. Who is most impacted? 
Marginalised non-technical users 

2. What features are problematic? 
Device usability 
Scope of data recorded 
How data is stored 
Confidence level of outputs/concern on over reliance 

3. What are the potential harms? 
Security leaks 
False negatives 
Over reliance  
Lack of accessibility  
Storing of unnecessary personal data 

4. Were there recurring themes? 
Accessibility 
Privacy/stage of information 
Accuracy 

MITIGATE: 
Technical Solutions: 
Encrypt data, opt-in/opt-out mechanisms, regular audits

Social Solutions: 
Diverse review board, legal safeguards to prevent data misuse, be clear about accuracy limitations 


JUDGEMENT: 
Moving forward, what’s the best solution for making a better product?

4. Conduct research on how a similar technology has been used. Pick two of the issues or
concerns in relation to the technology that were discussed by the stakeholders, which might
include fairness, transparency, explainability, and/or responsibility issues, ethical and/or dis-
crimination risks. Provide critical analysis on its impact with examples from similar or related
real-world technologies.
5. Compare your findings with your initial conceptual investigation. You may want to use a chart
or a table to describe, compare, and summarize your findings. Are there any agreements or
disagreements? Are the findings complementary? What can you conclude from this exercise?

How would the table look like that compares findings?
