# AI Heart Monitoring - KardiaMobile 6L

## Introduction
Introduction and background of tech: A clear focus, and a comprehensive explanation of the
AI/ADM technology. States the case study, and provides a clear context for the investigation
and the broad stakeholders and users.

KardiaMobile 6L is a personal ECG (Electrocardiogram) device that 
leverages AI to create a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for 
personal heart health monitoring. 

KardiaMobile 6L is a 6 lead personal ECG/EKG (Electrocardiogram) device,
powered by AI (Kardia, n.d).
An ECG is a test that measures the electrical pulses that trigger a heartbeat.
The 6 leads in the KardiaMobile refers to 6 pulses, e.g from arm-to-arm, arm-to-leg etc.

In its current state, the purpose of the KardiaMobile 6L is to 
facilitate the early detection of heart rhythm abnormalities to reduce the negative
impact of heart disease in the community (AliveCor, n.d).
Our proposed adoption of KardiaMobile would see this purpose amended to 
provide accessible and accurate heart monitoring for NDIS (National Disability
Insurance Scheme) clients situated in NSW, Australia. The goal of this would be 
to promote heart health for high needs individuals.
The NDIS is an Australian Government initiative that provides funding to people with
a disability to improve their quality of life (NDIS, 2024).

The objectives of the KardiaMobile 6L are:
  - Comprehensive: Capture a more detailed view compared to traditional ECG wearables.
  - Accurate: Perform AI ECG analysis to detect up to 6 types of arrhythmias.
  - Adaptable: Perform AI trend analysis to identify trigger points specific to an individual's heart rhythm changes.
  - Accessible: Easy to use and interpret by a non-technical user.

In its current deployment, the time frame of KardiaMobile is 
to provide a detailed ECG analysis in a 30 second window. In addition,
previous ECG reports can be saved for cumulative analysis to support routine monitoring.
Our suggested use of KardiaMobile has time frames in line with 
regular reporting periods matching individual NDIS health plans.
In addition, this would include scheduled monitoring aligned with NDIS carer visits.

Currently, KardiaMobile is primarily used in North America and Western Europe 
in a relaxed home setting. However, the portable design allows for use in other locations
such as a hospital or health clinic. This also gives the potential for 
integration in telemedicine and remote patient monitoring programs.
In our proposed plan, KardiaMobile would be used in NSW, Australia.
This would include NDIS approved accommodation settings such as a
communal living arrangements or NDIS day programs with support workers.

Currently, KardiaMobile is mainly used to perform regular heart monitoring at home
for individuals with known heart conditions. In addition, it also enables
the sharing of ECG data with healthcare providers to allow for more informed
decision making. In our use case, KardiaMobile would provide an easy-to-use heart
monitoring system for NDIS participants. Furthermore, it would 
integrate ECG sharing between NDIS support teams and healthcare providers.

Why do we need
Kardia in NSW?
Cardiovascular disease was among the
top five disease causing burden in
Australia in 2023.
People with disabilities are at a higher
risk for heart disease.
Cardiac events occur up to eight times
more frequently and have a higher risk of
death within this population.
Atrial fibrillation (which the KardiaMobile
6L can check for) can lower quality of
life and has a risk of stroke or heart
failure.
People with disabilities may also have
barriers to treatment due to fears
around certain tests such as a standard
ECG. The Kardia is less invasive and may
help alleviate this.

Benefits
Easier to disinfect than a standard 12L.
Minimal training for use making it easy for
support workers and carers to utilise it.
Provides immediate results on six types of
arrhythmias, alongside its portability, allows
patients with symptomatic palpitations to get an
ECG reading upon onset of symptoms.
Can be utilised in telemedicine, easing the
burden of travel for patients. This also lowers
the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by
allowing them to take appointments from home.
11/4/2024 9
Additional benefits
Potential for expanded use in treating patients with infectious diseases as
self-administered ECG reduces risk of infection to health care practitioners.
Has the potential to expand ECG availability to primary care facilities and
low-health resource regions due to relatively low cost and minimal training
required for use

## VSD Users/Stakeholders
Conceptual investigation of the chosen stakeholders: the stakeholders are well-described, with
the values and the frictions across the chosen principles to be well discussed and elaborated
across each stakeholder. A clear summary is provided at the end of the detailed descriptions.

## Critical Analysis
Research, analysis, and comparison: a sophisticated critical analysis of the possible positive
and negative impact of the studied AI/ADM technology, based on similar technology in the
literature or commercial systems that are already deployed. Discuss the possible mitigation
techniques or approaches to deal with the potential risks and ethical concerns of the studied AI
system. Well-justified usage and selection of the used data sources, figures, and/or references.

## Recommendations
Overall creative and critical thinking: Thinks out of the box, creates or extends to a novel
or unique investigation, incorporating feedback from the presentation session, a well-rounded
discussion and recommendation.
