# AI Heart Monitoring - KardiaMobile 6L

## Introduction
Introduction and background of tech: A clear focus, and a comprehensive explanation of the
AI/ADM technology. States the case study, and provides a clear context for the investigation
and the broad stakeholders and users.

KardiaMobile 6L is a personal ECG (Electrocardiogram) device that 
leverages AI to create a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for 
personal heart health monitoring. 

KardiaMobile 6L is a 6 lead personal ECG/EKG (Electrocardiogram) device,
powered by AI (Kardia, n.d).
An ECG is a test that measures the electrical pulses that trigger a heartbeat.
The 6 leads in the KardiaMobile refers to 6 pulses, e.g from arm-to-arm, arm-to-leg etc.

TODO:
clarify trad. ecg vs kardia

In its current state, the purpose of the KardiaMobile 6L is to 
facilitate the early detection of heart rhythm abnormalities to reduce the negative
impact of heart disease in the community (AliveCor, n.d).
Our proposed adoption of KardiaMobile would see this purpose amended to 
provide accessible and accurate heart monitoring for NDIS (National Disability
Insurance Scheme) clients situated in NSW, Australia. The goal of this would be 
to promote heart health for high needs individuals.
The NDIS is an Australian Government initiative that provides funding to people with
a disability to improve their quality of life (NDIS, 2024).

The objectives of the KardiaMobile 6L are:
  - Comprehensive: Capture a more detailed view compared to traditional ECG wearables.
  - Accurate: Perform AI ECG analysis to detect up to 6 types of arrhythmias.
  - Adaptable: Perform AI trend analysis to identify trigger points specific to an individual's heart rhythm changes.
  - Accessible: Easy to use and interpret by a non-technical user.

In its current deployment, the time frame of KardiaMobile is 
to provide a detailed ECG analysis in a 30 second window. In addition,
previous ECG reports can be saved for cumulative analysis to support routine monitoring.
Our suggested use of KardiaMobile has time frames in line with 
regular reporting periods matching individual NDIS health plans.
In addition, this would include scheduled monitoring aligned with NDIS carer visits.

Currently, KardiaMobile is primarily used in North America and Western Europe 
in a relaxed home setting. However, the portable design allows for use in other locations
such as a hospital or health clinic. This also gives the potential for 
integration in telemedicine and remote patient monitoring programs.
In our proposed plan, KardiaMobile would be used in NSW, Australia.
This would include NDIS approved accommodation settings such as a
communal living arrangements or NDIS day programs with support workers.


TODO:
be more clear that smartphones are required

Currently, KardiaMobile is mainly used to perform regular heart monitoring at home
for individuals with known heart conditions. In addition, it also enables
the sharing of ECG data with healthcare providers to allow for more informed
decision making. In our use case, KardiaMobile would provide an easy-to-use heart
monitoring system for NDIS participants. Furthermore, it would 
integrate ECG sharing between NDIS support teams and healthcare providers.

The primary motivation for our proposed adoption of KardiaMobile is 
to tackle cardiovascular disease.  In 2023, this was among the 
top five disease causing burden in Australia. People with disabilities are at a higher
risk for heart disease, with cardiac events occuring up to eight times
more frequently within this population. 

The main benefits of rolling out the KardiaMobile for NDIS participants are:
Early detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common type of heart arrhythmia, which can lower quality of life and increase the risk of stroke or heart failure. The KardiaMobile provides a non-invasive way to monitor heart health and detect potential issues.
Overcoming fears associated with traditional ECGs, as the KardiaMobile is less invasive and may help alleviate anxiety for people with disabilities who have concerns about standard ECG procedures.
Easier to disinfect compared to a standard 12-lead ECG, which is particularly important for people with disabilities who may have compromised immune systems.
Minimal training required for use, making it easy for support workers and carers to utilize the device effectively, thus increasing access to heart monitoring for people with disabilities.
Immediate results on six types of arrhythmias, combined with its portability, allows patients experiencing symptomatic palpitations to obtain an ECG reading at the onset of symptoms, leading to more timely diagnosis and treatment.
Potential for use in telemedicine, reducing the need for patients to travel to healthcare facilities, which can be particularly burdensome for people with disabilities. This also lowers the risk of infection for high-risk individuals by enabling remote appointments.
Expanded use in treating patients with infectious diseases, as the self-administered ECG reduces the risk of infection for healthcare practitioners.
Increased accessibility of ECG monitoring in primary care facilities and low-resource healthcare regions due to the relatively low cost and minimal training required to use the KardiaMobile effectively.


TODO: economic benefit of reduced hospital visitation
what economic benefits can we flag, high level societal benefits - 
e.g benefits from not transporting to hospital and ed visits.




description, users, etc.


## VSD Users/Stakeholders
Conceptual investigation of the chosen stakeholders: the stakeholders are well-described, with
the values and the frictions across the chosen principles to be well discussed and elaborated
across each stakeholder. A clear summary is provided at the end of the detailed descriptions.

TODO: what does ndis expect of us. contextualised framing, ndis is important stakeholder

TODO: 
opportunity for drs and health team members to help train NDIS participant 
dr will have interest in results and can provide training on the device as well. 
usage in hospitals is an opportunity for being part of the training.

TODO:
jake - if its a device to be used at home, clarification of why is it 
being deployed in a hospital (many NDIS participants with history of hospital visitations)



## Critical Analysis
Research, analysis, and comparison: a sophisticated critical analysis of the possible positive
and negative impact of the studied AI/ADM technology, based on similar technology in the
literature or commercial systems that are already deployed. Discuss the possible mitigation
techniques or approaches to deal with the potential risks and ethical concerns of the studied AI
system. Well-justified usage and selection of the used data sources, figures, and/or references.


TODO:
explainability and transparency. what are the rules and regulations in nsw around ai and healthcare

## Recommendations
Overall creative and critical thinking: Thinks out of the box, creates or extends to a novel
or unique investigation, incorporating feedback from the presentation session, a well-rounded
discussion and recommendation.

TODO:
where would user data be stored? how can doctors access the pt data? add to recommendations

TODO:
rolling it out in hospitals in additional to ndis

TODO:
add a comment on earliest rollout and what it would look like in nsw (royal commission etc) 
what does ndis expect of us. 

TODO:
clarify this basic tablet smartphone - add in ui design for pt

TODO:
what is the medical device software standard in NSW?
