* a priori: faculty of reason alone
* a posteriri: empirical evidence
* rationalism: a priori; universal (if cannot be applied universally, not valid)
* empiricisim: observation; subject to change
* naturalism: ignore social sciences
* argument: list of premises followed by conclusion (framework of reasoning)
  - valid: is if all premises assumed true than conclusion cannot be false.
  - sound: valid and premises are actually true
* consequentialism: concerned with consequences
* deontological: concerned if specific action is morally right or wrong (rationalist)
* normative ethics: establishes guidelines for how people should act, i.e. what is morally permissable

## UTILITARIANISM:
Choose option that leads to greatest overall happiness.
No such thing as a forbidden/taboo act.
An act is considered right or wrong based soley on consequence.
Positives:
  - Clear answers to moral questions
Negatives:
  - Immoral results (no special obligations to family)
  - Self-defeatist (trying to bring out happiness leads to unhappiness, e.g. lying brings about mistrust):
  - Cumbersome method (unrealistic view of human thinking to compute complex consequences of actions; our thoughts are conditioned by social structures)
RULE-UTILITARIANISM:
Follow rules instead of acts.
e.g. follow rule that only guilty people should be punished
could still have things like benevolent slavery

## KANTIANISM:
TODO: confused about universal law and autonomy? am I to let a person drown?

Human beings rationality gives us dignity/freedom, unlike animals that act on impulse.
Categorical imperative (fundamental principle of morality):
  - Universal law (rationalist morals, i.e. rational acts are one that can universalised)
  - Respect human dignity/freedom (have to let people make up their own mind)
    actions that are fundamentally wrong: decieve/manipulate/force
    a lie would be violating rational agent's autonomy to make up their own mind

  TODO: claims it's irrational to be immoral?
Positives:
  - Respect and trust paramount
Negatives:
  - Unable to prevent atrocities; only able to act thereafter (issue with deontology in general)
    (however can do so if concieve that the agent is no longer rational)
  - Universal law doesn't give any guidance on how to act in conflicting situations
  - Not comprehensive in that doesn't take into account human emotions

hypothetical imperative: only applies under some context
categorical imperative: applies under all contexts
kant has moral requirements are categorical imperatives
