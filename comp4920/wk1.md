a priori: faculty of reason alone
a posteriri: empirical evidence

argument is a list of premises followed by conclusion (framework of reasoning)
  IMPORTANT: view them all was whole
  - valid: is if all premises assumed true than conclusion cannot be false.
  - sound: valid and premises are actually true

normative ethics is concerned with how/guidelines people should act.
  - consequentialism, i.e. only concerned with outcome, not the inherent moral value of an action 
    - utilitarianism
      - act
      - rule

reasons must be epistemic, i.e able to grasp in head

rules are amenable to empirical feedback

utilitarianism system of ethics that focuses on choosing option that leads to greatest overall happiness.
a unit of happiness is utility.
(NOTE: consequentialist not necessarily utilitarian)
the idea of a forbidden/taboo act is conceived as a creation of culture (disabled human less use then a cow, however can kill a dog to eat)
so outcome is tangible, while whether something is forbidden is a grey area.
so, an act is considered right or wrong based soley on outcome.
gives a moral question a clear set of rules (no metaphysical abstractions) to make a quantifiable answer
(criticisms: infinite possible choices and indirect assumptions of non-empirical utility)
not clear that happiness is the only thing morally important

focused on naturalism (ignore social sciences), i.e. all beings equal
moral questions become technical questions

opposing to consequentialism, deontology is whether action is right or wrong

criticisms:
  * immoral results (no special obligations to family)
  * self-defeatist
   (can bring about self-defeating, i.e trying to bring out happiness leads to unhappiness):
  - PUNISHING: criminal and victim equal
               might punish innocent as guilty dead to bring deterrence
  - severely disabled 
  - stranger and family
  - your own happiness and others
  - TRUST: might renig a promise if get better utility doing otherwise
  * cumbersome method (unrealistic view of human thinking; our thoughts are conditioned by social structures)

Introduce rule-utilitarianism to counteract some (still has shortcomings to act-utilitarianism; so decide based empirical data)
what rule should everyone follow as oppose to act.
e.g. follow rule that only guilty people should be punished
could still have things like benevolent slavery
