* rationalism: a priori; universal (if cannot be applied universally, not valid)
* empiricisim: observation; subject to change
* naturalism: ignore social sciences
* argument: list of premises followed by conclusion (framework of reasoning)
  - valid: is if all premises assumed true than conclusion cannot be false.
  - sound: valid and premises are actually true
* consequentialism: concerned with consequences
* deontological: concerned if specific action is morally right or wrong (rationalist)
                 things are intrinsically right/wrong
* normative ethics: establishes guidelines for how people should act, i.e. what is morally permissable

## UTILITARIANISM:
Choose option that leads to greatest overall happiness.
No such thing as a forbidden/taboo act.
An act is considered right or wrong based soley on consequence.
Positives:
  - Clear answers to moral questions
Negatives:
  - Immoral results (no special obligations to family)
  - Self-defeatist (trying to bring out happiness leads to unhappiness, e.g. lying brings about mistrust):
  - Cumbersome method (unrealistic view of human thinking to compute complex consequences of actions; our thoughts are conditioned by social structures)
RULE-UTILITARIANISM:
Follow rules instead of acts.
e.g. follow rule that only guilty people should be punished
could still have things like benevolent slavery

## KANTIANISM:
IMPORTANT: type of rule-based ethics (deontological), different to rule-utilitarianism

IMPORTANT: Human beings rationality gives us dignity/freedom, i.e. act on reason
Unlike animals/children/insane that act on impulse.

Categorical imperative (fundamental principle of morality):
  - Universal law (rationalist morals, i.e. rational acts are one that can universalised)
    must be applicable at all times for everyone
  - Respect human dignity/freedom (have to let people make up their own mind)
    actions that are fundamentally wrong: decieve/manipulate/force
    a lie would be violating rational agent's autonomy to make up their own mind
  - To be irrational is to be immoral, i.e. not act within reason
    So, must be moral all the time
Positives:
  - Respect and trust paramount
Negatives:
  - Unable to prevent atrocities; only able to act thereafter (issue with deontology in general)
    (however can do so if concieve that the agent is no longer rational)
  - Universal law doesn't give any guidance on how to actually act, e.g. should I pursue money/fame etc. only what is permissable
  - Not comprehensive in that doesn't take into account human emotions

hypothetical imperative: only applies under some context
categorical imperative: applies under all contexts
kant has moral requirements are categorical imperatives

nutshell: right if conforms to a priori moral principle that is universally applied 
and that respects rational persons autonomy

## ARISTOTLEIAN VIRTUE ETHICS
Utilitarianism and kantianism impartial to special relations/emotions; 
become slaves of duty; ignore diversity of morality 

Engage with life to become a virtuous person; emotion is involved; cannot specify in advance
Without experience, gather inspiration from others

Virtues are traits someone does reliably and cares about.
Virtue ethics states moral if done out of your best virtues, i.e. what you have motivation for and that would show the best character.
A virtue is something that's needed to live how humans ought to (achieve a 'higher' life, i.e. flourish)

If do so, believed life will be happier

Rationality is what sets us apart from other animals.
So being rational is how we ought to live as best humans.

Doctrine of mean is to have the right emotional responses to the right things.
Rationality involves emotions, in that learn what emotions to apply to situations.
Each sphere of life has corresponding emotions.
Doctrine of mean: virtue lies on middle point of excess and deficiency, i.e. too much or too little
cannot specify what the good life is except by referring to the virtues
Virtues enable better engagement in social practices

nutshell: No direct answer how to live, but guidelines as how ought to live guided by virtues.
cultivate virtues through life experience

Negatives:
  - What defines how humans ought to live?
  - What defines mean of a virtue?
    (Unity of virtue, i.e. cannot know one virtue unless know them all)
    (experience of life is required to know how virtues constrain one another)
  - Absence of importance to rights
  - Gives complex and context-dependent answers
  - Egotistical over impartiality (developing oneself)
