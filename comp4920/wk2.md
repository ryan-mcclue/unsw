**Developing as a leader:
The power of mindful engagement**
## Leadership
mindful engagement approach:
1. leadership is about influencing people; not just a leader-like job title; 
it's state of mind focusing on collective needs
   i.e. anyone at any level can be a leader
   (military taught this structure)
2. skills relating to learning of leadership as oppose to leadership skills
   i.e. take responsibility for own leadership development throughout life; a constant undertaking
   leadership is a social construct;
   require mindfulness to take advantage of this

your identity is comprised of possible selves, e.g. intellectual, leader
discover leader identity through self-claiming and other people referring to you

based on mentality, same experience can yeild different learnings per individual
Set goals so develop self-awareness of developmental needs
1. Approach: have a learning mindset orientation, i.e. focus on learning rather than avoiding failure etc.
2. Actions: 
         * active experimentation
           test effectiveness of proposed solutions
         * feedback seeking
           gain insight as to how percieved by others
         * emotion regulation
           not to become too positively complacent or angry
           - understand motivation
           - discuss emotions with others
3. Reflection: Must reflect on experience to have experienced it; understand the what and why
            (did this at military after keystone events; considered what-ifs)

Military employed leadership rotation programs

identify facts, stakeholders, and obligations that you might not have considered previously
