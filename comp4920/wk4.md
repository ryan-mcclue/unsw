**Metaethics**
Exploring what right and wrong actually mean; the foundation of morality.
Morals can based on feelings or facts about the world.
Morality Semantics:
  - Cognitivism: moral statements express true or false beliefs
  - Non-Cognitivism: moral statements express something other than beliefs, like emotions

Ontology (what exists):
  - Moral Realism: morals are objective, existing independent of human beliefs.
  - Moral Relativism: morals are constructed 
Which of these are more or less conducive to tolerance of differing moral views.
TODO: Tolerance of other views and how to discuss with others disagreeing important to act in real world

Psychology (Motivations):
  - Motivational Internalism: morals intrinsically motivate us to act accordingly
  - Motivational Externalism: morals don't necessarily motivate; desires also impact

Epistemology (how we know exists):
  - Foundationalism: morals justified by relating to other basic morals
  - Coherentism: morals justified by relating to other beliefs

**Impossibilty of Fairness in ADM**
With human decision making, all 3 can be acheived simultaneously.
However, with AI, focusing on one negates the others.
So, for decisions that involve these traits, keep humans involved in decision making.
- Accountability: Explanation of decision based on beliefs
  * With high complexity of models, decision making process is opaque.
    Difficult to explain why a decision was made.
- Fairness: Normative salience (are beliefs reasonably justified) of imbued decisions
- Transparency: Communicate reasoning
  * Although statistical reasoning, doesn't capture normative salience

cognitivism: moral statements can be objectively true (truth apt)
(e.g. divine command theory, moral subjectivism)

non-cognitivism: can't be true or false; saying something is wrong is just an expression of feeling
