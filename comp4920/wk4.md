**Impossibilty of Fairness in ADM**
With human decision making, all 3 can be acheived simultaneously.
However, with AI, focusing on one negates the others.
So, for decisions that involve these traits, keep humans involved in decision making.
- Accountability: Explanation of decision based on beliefs
  * With high complexity of models, decision making process is opaque.
    Difficult to explain why a decision was made.
- Fairness: Normative salience (are beliefs reasonably justified) of imbued decisions
- Transparency: Communicate reasoning
  * Although statistical reasoning, doesn't capture normative salience
