**Reflective Equilibrium** 
Emphasis on justification and coherence is relevent to far reaching impacts on AI technology

Reflective equilibrium is method for justifying moral/political principles.
Does so by bringing moral judgements into coherence with principles and background theories.
- Starting Point: Make considered judgements (made in ideal conditions)
  e.g. initial judgement on resulting values: In favour as although lose privacy, gain security and safety
- Consider Relevent Principles and Background Theories:
  - utilitarianism: would safety maximise happiness?
  - kantianism: do individuals have fundamental right to privacy?
  - virtue ethics: do we want a society that prioritises safety over privacy? 
  - social psychology: how might impact on behaviour
  - political science: historical precedents for abuse of power
  - computer science: accuracy of technology
- Mutual Adjustment: Revise judgements to achieve coherence (explanatory and background support)
  e.g. might soften stance
- Tentative Equilibrium: Reach compromise of differing stances


**Principles and Principilism**
Principalism useful for navigating ethical dilemmas in healthcare.
Four principles:
  1. Respect for autonomy
  2. Nonmaleficence
  3. Beneficence
  4. Justice
Principles are guidelines not rigid rules. 
Can be refined to specific contexts.
