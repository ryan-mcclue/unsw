; IMPORTANT(Ryan): So, 16bit address space.
; Unique to program memory is that it's arranged with 'word addresses', i.e. each address holds 16bits (in contrast to normal byte addresses)
; We pass in say 0x0000 as a byte address, but must convert to word-address equivalent, i.e. addr*2, addr*2+1
; so, special address semantics when working with program memory
