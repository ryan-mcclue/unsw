# Week 1 - Astrophysics - Space Time
The milky way orbits a black hole

The three-body problem refers to the difficulty in resolving the orbital paths of 3 objects

Spacetime is viewing space and time as conjoined.

Einstein's general relativity has superseded Newton's universal gravitation. 
Gravity is determined by the curvature of space time. Mass causes this curvature.

How an object accelerates affects how it experiences gravity. 
An accelerating mass will propagate gravitional waves at the speed of light.
So, the Sun sends out gravitational waves that travel at the speed of light.
Therefore, Earth is attracted to where the Sun was ~8 minutes ago.

Affects of curved spacetime:
1. Under the influence of an extreme gravitational field, time slows down (gravitational time dilation)
2. Gravitational lensing is a large distribution of matter that is capable of bending light from source to observer.

The stronger the gravitational field (i.e, the more space time is curved), the slower time passes for you relative to an observer

However, time is also affected when an object moves (speed of light is constant, special relativity)
Faster you move, relative to an observer: 
 - time passes slower
 - length contracts
 - mass gets larger

Eventually Earth will lose its magentic field when the inner core solidifies (like on the moon and Mars)

Proxima Centuri closest  the remnant core of a dead starstar. Magellic clouds dwarf galaxies orbitting milky way. Andromeda closest galaxy

Parallax is apparent change in position of something based on change in observers point of view, e.g. if we look straight up say 6 months apart on Earth, the we are looking at a different location 
TODO: What is a parsecs
IMPORTANT: Carl Zimmer interview is to understand the 'rules' that make good scientific writing, i.e. does it make it interesting, accessible and worth knowing.
Hopefully have the reader leave with a new understanding/viewpoint of the universe/world

# Week 2 - Astrophysics - Entropy, Extreme Space Objects
IMPORTANT: Harvard style references at end of writing assignments
Time always moves forward (although theoretically possible to go backwards, it requires extreme space time curvature, like a black hole, so not practical)
Non-reversible processes (most processes), i.e. most processes in the universe have a direction associated with them (not symmetric under time)
Something like ice-melting is not going to spontaneously undo itself 
Energy is only useful when clumped together. when you use it, it becomes more spread out. So, entropy is a measure of how spread out your energy is.
Entropy can also be thought of how disordered a system is, e.g. ice has a highly organised crystalline structure, when becomes water molecules more spread out, i.e. entropy increased
Entropy is always increasing. There is constantly many non-reversible reactions going on from the microscopic (fusion) to macroscopic (breathing, eating, etc.)
Nuclear fusion powers stars and is when two nucleui merge to form another of less mass overall, but heavier individually e.g. 4 hydrogen into helium, thereby releasing excess energy (e=mc^2)
Almost all elements in the universe formed in stars
Time going forward is linked with increase in entropy. So, when all actions to increase entropy have occurred (trillions of years), time ceases to be relevent 
White dwarf is the remnant core of a dead star that has run out of fuel. It's extremely dense.
A supernova is an explosion that occurs because of instabilities or mergers.
Type 1 requires at least one white dwarf involved in a merger
Type 2 is when a massive star gets to a point where its producing too heavy elements that results in a loss of energy, e.g. iron. 
The energy the star requires to combat gravity is gone, so it collapses and all the protons and electrons form to neutrons. This releases a huge amount of energy.
There are up to 3 different remnants from this type 2 supernova; a neutron star, nothing or black hole
Stellar flares are when a star's magnetic field lines realign and release a large amount of energy and eject material at high speed. They are also accompanied by the emission of x-rays, gamma-rays and plasma.
Fortunately, Earth's magnetic field and ozone protect us from this
Radio jets are material spewing from the centre of a galaxy close to the speed of light and emitting strong radio waves (so black holes can also eject, i.e. driving these jets)

We know universe is expanding by measuring doppler shift of other galaxies in the universe. The doppler effect tells us that waves emitting from a moving source in the direction of motion, i.e. in front, will be squished together and behind will be stretched out.
Blue light has a shorter wavelength, red longer. So, a galaxy moving away from us will appear redder than it really is, i.e. is redshifted
We notice that all galaxies are moving away from us. The further away they are, the faster they are moving (we postulate dark energy is responsible for this)
Because of this expansion, we could say the universe will last for infinity. However, it will be rather bleak say trillions of years from now, with stars using all their energy.
The state of the universe trillions of years from now is not an exact science. It's an example of in science where people's interpretations/world-view's reach different conclusions
By calculating the doppler velocity, we can tell approximatley how long ago the universe was at its singularity (around 14 billion years)

# Week 3 - Astrobiology - Exoplanets
A nebula is a giant cloud of gas and dust.
Stars produce their own light. Planets orbit stars.
A planetary system is any star and its planets. They are formed when a large cloud of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity, forming a protostar and eventually the end result.
So, a sun and planets are created at the same time.
As the centre of this protostar (a protosun) is extremely hot, the constituents of a planet are determined by how far away it is from the protosun (or where it sits in the protoplanetary disk)
The closer the more solid object can form like metals and rock, then ice, than gases. This is referred to as the architecture of a planetary system.
However, after discovering the first exoplanet that orbited a sun-like star, we realised that this architecture is not entirely accurate as the many exoplantary systems are so diverse
The moon was formed as a result of a collision with the Earth occuring in the protostar phase
A meteor is a small piece of rock. It is what would fall to Earth as a shooting star. An asteroid is a much larger piece of rock located in asteroid belt. A comet is another icey rock mainly in kuiper belt.
To be considered a planet:
  * be not too large that nucluer fusion occuring
  * not too small that gravity has not made it spherical (like an asteroid) 
  * it must be the only thing in its orbit (otherwise dwarf planet)
Naming of stars: 
  * if contains greek letter like alpha, beta, gamma etc. this references degree of brightness
  * if contains name, referencing constellation
  * if contains number prefix, latitude/longitude  
  * if contains text prefix, referencing catalogue, e.g. Kepler is all discovered by kepler satellite. Subsequent number is order of discovery
The name of the exoplanet that appends 'b', 'c', etc. to these star names

The process of forming planets is not calm. They can have their orbits changed:
  * dynamical friction: the large body moves through a series of smaller bodies which then follow it in its wake. This causes the larger body to slow down and have its orbit decay.
  * three-body interactions (e.g. sun, earth, another planet): interact with neighbouring planets and exchange energy causing inward or outward orbital changes (could even be ejected, becoming a rogue planet)

Tidal locking is where a planet is very close to its star, such that only one face of it ever faces the star. The moon does this with Earth, hence the near side and far side

Clarify habitable it terms of what you are doing, e.g. interstellar travel, permanent habitation etc. 
It doesn't necessarily mean an Earth-like planet, as we could artificially create certain things
The habitable zone is range of orbits around a star that a planet should be the right temperature to support liquid water. So, is just a measure of distance from star related to its temperature
However, doesn't take into account possible greenhouse effect (planet's atmosphere), volcanic activity, could be entirely water (resulting social needs for society) etc.
Therefore, the habitable zone is a very basic indicator 
1 AU is a measure of the distance between the Earth and the Sun

Reasons for travelling outer space are to perform science experiments (how does bacteria survive in a high radiation environment), space tourism, commercialism, political, military, earth uninhabitable

# Week 4 - astrobiology
To be considered life it must: metabolism (convert outside energy to something it can use), homeostasis (maintain internal state), growth, reproduction 
Extremophiles on Earth can give us some indication of what possible extra-terrestial life could be: cold(psychrophilic; under antarctic glaciers)/hot(hydrothermal vents) temperatures, 
acidity/salinity(halophilic)/radioactivity(fungus found in Chernobyl), no oxygen. Incredibly resistent to all aforementioned things are tardigrades (water bears)
Geothermal is heat from within the Earth

Exoplanet detection:
* Transits (radius of planet)
  Detect change in brightness of star when the planet blocks it through its orbit (Kepler and TESS satellites seen huge results here)
  Observational bias to planets with short orbital periods and large radius
* Radial Velocity (can tell use the mass of the planet)
  Detect changes in blueshift and redshift as a planet orbits its star and is slightly pulled to us and pulled away from us
  Observational bias to heavy massed planets
* Direct Imaging (only one that looks for planet directly as oppose to looking at the effect the planet has on its star)
  As star much more luminous than planets, have to block light from star. This can leave artifacts however, so require years of continual images to ensure dots are planets and not artifacts

  By utilising radius and mass of planet can calculate its density and compare that to known planets in our solar system so as to make educated guess as to the constituents of the planet, e.g. gas giant
  So, all beautiful pictures of planets are illustrations only. The only actual images are blobs from direct imaging

Harder than planet detection is determining the planet's atmosphere. Transit spectroscopy compares light of star and than light when planet is blocking and determining what has been absorbed by the atmosphere
Can then look at biosignatures, i.e. what would be produced by life (methane, CO2) or required by life (water)

# Week 5 - climate change
As stars and planets form at the same time, Sun is 4.5billions years old, so is the Earth (undergone dramatic changes, e.g. atomospheric composition, land placement)
Some processes that affect the entire Earth take a long time to occur, e.g. plate tectonics (225 million years ago Pangea; due to convection currents in the mantle; fossils found of same animal in different continents at the same time), ice ages (deep rocks can contain minerals from past to help determine atmospheric composition back then)
However some are fast (on a geological time scale), e.g. human induced climate change, magnetic field reversal
Initially earth's atmosphere was largley methane, little oxygen. However these anarobic bacteria developed photosynthesis, producing oxygen. This reduced temperature of Earth as methane is a greenhouse gas, kicking off an ice-age
Earth's magnetic field due to core rotating made of molten metals. It's polarity can change (random), as determined by inspecting magnetic sensitive molecules in igneous rocks and how they are aligned.
66 million years ago 50km asteriod impact for mass extinction of dinosaurs in mexico (iridium  found in sedimentary rock layers 66 million years ago)

Since late 19th century, global average temperature has been increasing.
Going up by only 1.5 degrees, this causes: polar ice caps melting (freshwater affecting salinity and circulation), bushfire risk, ocean acidification, rising sea levels
Greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere such as CO2, methane (29x more effective), nitrous oxide (298x more effective), trap infrared radiation
This raises the equilibrium temperature in relation to the 'habitable zone'
The entire EM spectrum is emitted by the Sun. UV is absorbed by ozone, IR by greenhouse gases, visible light passes through and warms the Earth's surface and then re-radiates as IR
Carbon footprint collects all greenhouse gases and indicates how much CO2 would be emitted to be equivalent. 
Average car produces 2.4 tonnes CO2 equivalent, 1kg of beef is 60kg CO2
Average Australian yearly carbon footprinpt of 26tonnes of CO2-equivalent.
Greatest carbon-footprints are companies, particularly energy companies. Also bitcoin, supercomputers have high energy requirements 
As such, large scale incentives like carbon tax, businesses not investing in fossil fuel companies etc. are of greater importance than individual actions like not using a car, eating less meat etc.
The ozone hole is over Antarctica. Despite the ozone hole being reduced since its discovery in 1985, ozone depleting compounds like CFCs persist for a long time. So, will return to normal in 2070 as we have stopped putting these chemicals into the atmosphere
So, while the Earth has undergone large changes, human activity has seen similar changes occur at much faster rate and widespread rates

300 million years in the future, plate tectonics will result in one large supercontinent again.
Moon will recede from Earth (retreats 4cm a year due to lost orbital energy from controlling Earth's tides)
Waiting into the future, rare events can occur like a nearby supernova
Sun currently undergoes fusion with Hydrogen to Helium. 
However in the future when the Sun's source of Hydrogen becomes more scarce it will have to raise its temperature to maintain fusion. So, it will get brighter.
Eventually all Hydrogen will be gone, so the next reaction is with Helium. 
However this requires much higher temperatures. 
The core will contract and the shell will dramatically expand. This is red giant phase.
This changes the habitable zone to Jupiter and Saturn (however will be when Sun is 12.5 billion years old)
Milky Way will collide with Andromeda and become one smooth system (as mostly empty space). There black holes will merge
