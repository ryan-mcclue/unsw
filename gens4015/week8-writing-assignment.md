Often fictional astronauts are presented as highly public figures 
(think Mark Watney in The Martian or Elma in The Lady Astronaut of Mars) 
or scrappy outlaws (think Firefly or Cowboy Bebop). 
What other archetypes of astronauts and space travelers do you like, 
and what roles do they play in their world?  

The captain in *Infested* presents himself as the 'considerate introvert' archetype.
The captain's role is to ensure the wellbeing of his crew and to pilot the ship.
I like the compassion and reassuring father-figure traits that are indicative of this archetype.
The captain's ability to sooth the nervousness of his fellow crew members is demonstrated 
when he downplays the seriousness of the hidden camera's initial discovery "It's probably just a prototype"
Later as another crew member begins to worry about people's perceptions of their actions recorded by the cameras, he
redirects their focus towards things they can control "We can't control how others react."
The captain's composure surrounded by angst beings to be seen as unnatural by some crew members "How can you be so calm about this?".
To demonstrate that the captain is not devoid of emotion, he eventually succumbs to the anxiety
"To date I had avoided searching my own cabin, but as the hours to re-entry counted down, I lost it."
As he experiences these emotions first hand, his words of comfort are all the more genuine.
As outlined in the lectures, space is a dangerous environment for humans.
I find it comforting to have someone who can stay resolute in a high pressure situation which is quite likely to occur in space.

In the TV series *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, Data is an android who fits the 'introverted genius' archetype.
I like the nuanced observations and complex calculations made by people of this archetype.
Data's primarily role is Operations Manager, however he also frequently works in the engineering department.
Due to their incredibly high intellect, people of this archetype are often disconnected from the general population.
Data aligns with this stereotype. He wants what most of his crewmates take for granted.
In his journey to develop his emotional intelligence, he provides a unique insight into what it means to be human.
Data demonstrates a lack of personal ambition and is entirely devoted to his work.
This is due to his archetype, which makes him a contributor by nature.
His standards are flawless and his work is imbued with impeccable efficiency and neatness. 
He is able to perform extremely sophisticated computations to solve any task.
As outlined in the lectures, space travel is complex.
I enjoy witnessing someone capable of understanding and processing all those difficulties to producing high-quality outcomes.
