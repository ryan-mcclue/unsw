While you present convincing evidence that ‘the development of sedentary cultures increased the frequency of warlike interactions’ 
in Central and North West Europe at the start of the Neolithic, 
you do not present convincing evidence that this is true for other parts of the world.
EARLIER ON YOU MENTION ONLY TALKING ABOUT ONE REGION EUROPE. HOW CAN SATISFY BOTH OF THESE?

origins of warfare in Europe...

ESSENTIALLY TALK ABOUT EARLIER EVIDENCE OF VIOLENCE AND SPECIFIC THEORIES

When stated missing major publications, is this in reference to evidence or theories?

* provide specific numerical time period talking about. talk about specific geographic area.
* only discuss Europe
* discuss evidence of millions of years ago on early hominins (further back than stone age). 
so, talk more about hominins, rather than just homo sapiens?
* include more biological anthropological references and their varied main arguments.
* if mentioning an anthropologist, give their main argument (e.g. Keely warfare is common in small-scale societies and was likely common throughout human evolutionary history)

# Warfare an evolutionary perspective 
the propensity to be aggressive in order to out-perform
competing groups and gain fitness-related benefits is a trait that is likely
to be deeply rooted in human evolutionary history. 
(therefore, early hominins not warring)

The degree of organization among group members,
advance planning, division of labor, and use of tactic observed in
state-level warfare is rather unique not seen in early hominins 

Indeed, weapons or skeletal traumas could indicate
war or be due to other factors, including hunting of game or intra-
group violence.

warfare is a recent phenomenon in evolutionary terms and often
occurred at low frequency before state-level societies. Therefore
warfare has not exerted significant evolutionary pressure on
humans

current work suggests that humans have an
evolved propensity to act aggressively toward outgroup individuals,
under specific ecological conditions, irrespective to when warfare first
emerged and how frequently occurred during the course of human
evolution. 
violence has evolutionary basis, but has been accelerated by cultural influences

# Early Hominin Violence
They claim that frequently used archeological indicators of lethal violence
are ambiguous, particularly those dating much earlier than around
15,000 years BP: signs of spears and of other weapons on skeletal
remains may be related to any kind of violence, such as family dis-
putes and mortuary cannibalism, or to post-mortem burial procedures
that have nothing to do with warfare. Similarly, archeological remains
of weapons may equally indicate warfare or hunting of large prey.
The only relatively unequivocal signs of warfare appear in the last
15,000–8,000 years, approximately around or immediately after the
agricultural revolution.

Furthermore, reasons for aggression may be 'rational':
Some divide aggression into proactive and reactive types
(Feshbach, 1964) while others take a more direct approach. Scholars
may want to separate fear-based aggression from predatory aggres-
sion, and sex-related aggression from territorial aggression (Siegel &
Victoroff, 2009). However, this may oversimplify the case as aggres-
sion can often be mixed and not all occurrences can fit neatly into
ideal types. As Siegel and Victoroff (2009) note, “human aggression is
more difficult to pigeonhole. Inter-male aggression, such as gang fight-
ing, involves a mix of planning and highly charged affect. Territorial
wars serve instrumental purposes but engage high nationalistic emo-
tions” (p. 210).

Some researchers also point out that violence between individuals
does not equate with war, and that war is more than one violent act.
“One-person-killing-one person reflects homicide or manslaughter, not
coalitional killings or war” (Fry & Soderberg, 2013, p. 272). 

Currently, the available evidence suggests that the first signals for
highly sophisticated, modern human behavior, cultural complexity, or
what we might call “uniquely human capabilities” (Pickering, 2013),
behavioral modernity, or behavioral variability, appear in the archaeo-
logical record within the past two to three hundred thousand years
(Bouzouggar et al., 2007; d'Errico et al., 2003; Henshilwood, d'Errico,
Vanhaeren, Niekerk, & Jacobs, 2004; McBrearty & Brooks, 2000;
Shea, 2011).

First, it does not
speak to frequency or intensity of warfare activities. Second, it does
not argue that warfare was a causal factor or driver for human evolu-
tionary change. On the contrary, complex forms of sociality and coop-
eration were necessary precursors for ancestral humans to engage in
emergent warfare. These were also necessary for emergent peace-
making, for that matter. As suggested by intriguing primatological
research on extant primates, the roots of human peace-building may
be tied to agonism, restrained fighting, and other behaviors of conflict
avoidance (Fry & Szala, 2013). In our estimation, behavioral modernity
allowed humans to create culturally laden and complex mechanisms
to promote both peaceful and violent interactions.

Third, and perhaps most importantly, we believe that the study of
both emergent warfare and emergent peacemaking needs to be
explicitly tied to ongoing research on the origins of behavioral moder-
nity or behavioral variability. 

In the end, the notion that emergent warfare would have been
possible within the Pleistocene is admittedly speculative and hypo-
thetical, requiring much more evidentiary support. However, acknowl-
edging the possibility allows us to continue posing appropriate
questions.

# Sedentary Violence
Bowles claims that groups of early humans
frequently encountered one another and aggressively competed over
valuable resources such as food or shelter

Alternatively, They argue that population density
of human groups has been estimated to be very low until around
15,000–8,000 years BP. Therefore, groups had few chances to meet
with one another, were not competing over limited resources and
were rarely waging war.

Dunbar's number

These abilities allowed for complex forms of intra- and
intergroup behavior to develop, and the range of interactions could
have included violent practices. We are not arguing that the Pleisto-
cene world was filled with rampant violence. The archaeological study
of warfare in the Holocene has revealed times with virtually no signs
of violent conflict in various world regions (Keeley, 2014, p. 30). Nev-
ertheless, rather than assuming that the absence of evidence indicates
the absence of warfare, perhaps another way to view the record is to
consider the possibility that varied cultural mechanisms developed by
which past human communities attempted to prevent outbreaks of
organized violence and maintain “peace” (see Dye, 2013; Ferguson,
2013a, 2013b; Fry, 2006; Milner et al., 2013).

# Cultural
Our view generally sees outbreaks of intergroup violence not sim-
ply as reactive outcomes to certain environmental conditions or social
cues. Instead, the argument sees warfare as stemming from culturally
constituted motivations for violence. This type of cause or motivation
for warfare emphasizes the cultural dimensions of warfare more than
other views, such as Wrangham (1999)'s “imbalance of power”
hypothesis, which emphasizes warfare as adaptive and rooted in
genetic predispositions. For Wrangham (1999, p. 19), raiding derives
from the advantages of gaining intergroup dominance and an ability
to assess power imbalances in an environment of intergroup hostility,
as well as power imbalances between parties from neighboring com-
munities. While we are open to the hypothesis that imbalances of
power could have been a contributing factor for coalitional killing
among ancestral humans, we would emphasize the importance of the
cultural dimensions of decision-making and practices related to both
warfare and peacemaking. This view is not dissimilar from Wrangham
(1999, p. 24)'s argument that culture can mediate perceptions of
power and the perceived benefits of using violence or avoiding it.

The degree of organization among group members, advance planning, division of  labor, 
and use of tactic observed instate-level warfare is rather unique not seen in early hominins (Majolo)

# TO CONDENSE
Radiocarbon dating of LBK stone tools and pottery
show their arrival to have occurred approximately 7000 years ago (Keely, 1997). 

Pollen analysis performed on LBK sites show evidence of land clearing, while inspection
of LBK food remains show a diet consisting almost entirely of agricultural foods (Keely, 1997).

LBK culture was not in any way comparable to the culture of the native Mesolithic foragers
(Keely, 1997). 

The similarity between the radiocarbon dates of the latest Mesolithic sites and
earliest LBK sites indicate Mesolithic lifeways died quickly following LBK arrival (Keely,
1997). 

Therefore, LBK farmers represent a marked transition to a more sedentary way of human
life.

There are both short-term and long-term consequences of the sedentary LBK culture that
create an environment where warfare seems reasonable. In the short-term, a sedentary culture
intrudes on the land of native foragers who are unable to yield territory due to their scattered
food sources. In the long-term, a sedentary culture removes the ability to move away from
situations building to violence (Ferguson, 1997). Furthermore, as resources are no longer
fluctuating or scattered, there is less need to maintain cooperative bonds with others as was
essential in humanity's evolutionary past (Jurmain, 2016). Evidence of warfare in LBK culture
3can be seen in the remains of fortified settlements (v-shaped ditches and palisades), stockpiling
of weapons in enclosures (arrow-heads and axes) and mass burial graves containing skeletons
with perimortem cranial trauma consistent with LBK axe blows (Keely, 1997).
