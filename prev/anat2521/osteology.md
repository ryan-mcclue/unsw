# Osteology
Have valid licence then: bodies donated, embalmed (formaldehyde), kept for 4 years, then reconciled and cremated
Handle bones delicatley, e.g. don't pick up skull through eye sockets

* Process -> extension 
* Fossa -> depression 
* Foramen -> hole 
* Articular -> joint (where two bones meet)
* Tuberosity -> roundness
* Condyle -> tuberosity near end of long bone (to provide structural support)
* Subcutaneous -> under skin
* Peri -> around
* Endo -> within
* Superior (closer to head), Inferior (closer to feet)
* Anterior/ventral (front), Posterior/dorsal (behind)
* Medial (closer to middle), Lateral
* Proximal (closer to point of limb attachment), Distal
* Length is longest side. Longitudinal is running lengthwise
* Sesamoid (embedded in tendon, e.g. patella)
* Condyle (roundness near joint)

Axial Skeleton: 
  * Skull:
    * Cranial
      * Frontal -(coronal)- parietal -(sagittal)- occipital -(lambdoid)- temporal
    * Facial
      * Nasal, maxilla, zygomatic, mandible
  * Veterbral Column:
    * Cervical(7, cc), thoracic(12, cx, kyphosis), lumbar(5, cc, lordosis), sacral(5, fused becoming the sacrum bone), coccyx(approx 4?, cx)
  * Thoracic Cage:
    * 12 pairs of ribs (true and false), sternum

Appendicular Skeleton:
  * Clavicle connects to manubrium (part of sternum), i.e. axial skeleton
  * 8 carpal in 2 rows (wrist), 5 metacarpal form palm, 3 phalanges form fingers (thumb has 2)
  * 7 tarsals form ... (talus ankle, calcaneous heel), metatarsal midfoot, phalanges toes (big toe has 2)

things like hip, sacral ... are not fused until adulthood

Bones will have hard section (compact bone) and soft section (spongy bone)

Metaphysis is where the bone is lengthening. Epiphyses is end points. Diathysis is shaft

Usefulness of Bones: 
* Information on lifestyle, point of comparison, evidence of existence
* Some serve to protect: skull (brain), rib cage (thoracic viscera)
* Support movement and stability
Forces on femur when walking: compression on medial, tension on lateral side of shaft
Bone responds to forces by laying down new bone. So a lack of forces it causes resorption and grow weaker
Slowest rates of remodelling in thickest areas of compact bone
Once adulthood, bones cannot grow longer but can still grow thicker and thinner (this can be seen comparing bone sizes between dominant and non-dominant arm in tennis players)
* Bone marrow produces blood cells, bones also store fats and minerals.
So, bones have blood vessels (vein towards heart, artery away from, capillary between vein and arteries)

(although irregular some people can have other sesamoid bones, extra/missing rib, sutural bones) 

Bone cells: osteoblast produces, osteoclast absorbs. an osteocyte matures from an osteoblast

Most bone is formed from cartilage (endochondral ossification). So, the bone outline is cartilage and then gradually replaced with bone

More interested in the 2/3 inorganic chemical composition of bone to determine diet and where they came from through isotope analysis?
Hydroxyapatite hardest thing in body. Higher concentration of it in tooth enamel than bone
Longer buried under ground, the less organic in bone. So, it becomes more and more brittle 
Nearly all of the body's calcium is stored in the bones

Tooth has top layer above gums called a crown (with enamel), then neck, and then long root with nerve endings
Peridontal ligament connects tooth root to tooth socket
Adults have 32 teeth, 4 quadrants, 8 in each (dental formula for humans and most primates is 2 incisors, 1 canine, 2 pre molars and 3 molars)

All living things absorb carbon, of use to us is the neutral radioactive carbon isotope

Hematoma is a large injury to blood vessel (as oppose to a bruise) resulting in a pooling of blood outside the blood vessel.
A callus will be formed as a bone fracture heals
