# Week 3 - Modern Human Variation and Osteometry
Deme: population defined in terms of genetic composition, i.e. allele frequencies
Species -> subspecies/race (can obviously still interbreed, so there is gene flow) -> 
population
Cline: gradations in a trait within a population, e.g. skin colour

Historically biological determinism (behaviour determined solely by genetics) 
leading to eugenics (racial out-breeding) with Europeans as superior
Similarly, typology was used to categorise subraces.

Humans first evolved from Africa, spread out and interbred with Neanderthals and Denisovans
Greater genetic variety seen amongst Africans then any other geographic region in the world.
Took some time for people to accept all humans evolved from the same ancestor.
New World is Americas, Old World is Europe, Asia and Africa.
Inhabited the New World from Asia via land bridge

Race is a dubious term. It tends to mean phenotypic variation across geographical areas.
However there are no fixed-set guidelines to assess someone's race.
This leads to the circular question of how many races are there?
Genetic studies (subfield as population genetics) have shown that even within groups 
the amount of genetic variation is large.
In fact, although two people may differ in particular phenotypes, the amount of other 
shared traits may be high, e.g. head shape, blood type etc.
Furthermore, certain phenotypes are influenced by the environment as well
(e.g. Lemba people in Mozambique had oral history that they were Jewish, 
however due to their similar appearance to other Africans it was doubted.
Genetics showed they were. So, an example of genotype and phenotypes differences)
(e.g. Even identical twins (single sperm one egg that splits) look different)
(e.g. Different adaptations developed in similar conditions with Tibetans and Andean people)
Therefore, race is not biological meaningful. Instead, use the term population/ancestry
However, there are some genes that indicate a person's geographical ancestry

Homo sapiens are a polytypic species (vast phenotypical differences amongst populations) 
Genetic drift has seen humans develop varied adaptations in response to particular 
environmental stresses to maintain homeostasis
Furthermore, biocultural influences have affected this also

Plasticity: ability to respond physiologically to environment (no change in genotype)
Adaptability is a positive form of plasticity
(e.g. growing up in high altitude result in larger lungs and broader chest, yet same genotype)
Acclimatisation is a short-term adaptibility (increase in hemoglobin at high altitude, tanning)
Adaptation is genotype change, i.e. natural selection

Population is one that is capable of interbreeding, thus sharing a gene pool.
Various breeding isolates, e.g. geography, cultural
Endogamy (breeding within group), exogamy (breeding out of group)
To determine if evolution occuring at a locus, compare allele frequency with that predicted 
by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
This also emphasises the fact that populations evolve, not individuals

Focus on polymorphic traits, i.e. genes with two or more alleles occuring more than 1% 
(meaning different expression of same trait)
e.g. sickle-cell (balanced polymorphism, i.e. maintained heterozygous/carrier), lactase persistence, skin colour, etc.
Can give indication of founder's effect
Haplotype is a combination of polymorphisms

HLAs (white blood cells antigens) is the most polymorphic trait in humans 
(hundreds of alleles, multiple loci)

Responses to Heat:
* Radiation: Vasodilation causes capillaries to widen and allow more blood flow and 
             thereby lose more heat to the environment
             Vasoconstriction reduces blood flow, thereby retaining heat 
* Convection: to air molecules
* Conduction: physical contact
* Evaporation: Sweat glands allow evaporation cooling (more effective with less body hair) 
               which can be dangerous losing many vitamins and water.

To generate heat, increase metabolic rate which breaks down nutrients to generate energy 
and therefore heat (also shiver)

Bergemann (more mass, non-linear shape suited for cold)
Allen (longer trunk, shorter limbs suited for cold)
Gloger (heavily pigmented in warmer)
Thomson (thin nose in colder)

Responses to Solar Radiation (primarily skin adaptations):
pigments (carotene:orange, melanin (melanocytes is octopus looking cell), hemoglobin)
epidermis has carotene (for toughness) and melanin
dermis has sebaceous glands, sweat glands, hair follicle
* Darker skin (higher levels of melanin) reduces UV radiation. 
  As cancer is pronounced after reproducing, most likely due to inhibiting folate production in pregnant women.
* Lighter skin (wearing animal skins) for vitamin D for bone development and fighting infections 

Up until 15kya. humans lived in hunter-gatherer groups, living a rather nomadic lifestyle. 
So, they never stayed neared refuse heaps to develop infections
The birth of agriculture changed this with zoonotic infections (also burying dead together)
such as tuberculosis, HIV, influenza (swine or bird), malaria
Increase in global warming can also increase viral vectors

For chimps, they carried SIV, however when given to humans 
(in Africa they sell butchered chimp) turned to HIV 
Some Europeans resistent to smallpox seem to also affect the receptors involved with HIV

Until recently, infectious diseases the main cause of human death

From skeleton, can infer:
Disease/Trauma: syphylus, ricking, fracture heals, embedded materials from weapons, etc.
Lifestyle: Have osteoarthritis (in particular areas indicating higher activity there)
Diet: Permanently formed tooth enamel as a child reveals childhood diet. 
      Carbon and nitrogen concentrations in bone indicate if eating plants, terrestrial or marine animals
      Tooth decay

----------------------------------------
How can we be so polytypic, e.g. vast genetic drift, biocultural influences, yet also be genetically similar compared to other primates? (so just phenotypical?)
how prnounced are genotype differences in sex?

when taking measurement of a long bone, make sure shaft is parallel to ruler

note name (least circumference) to infer possible meaning if not sure

for formula ranging from positive to negative, negative more female

note the anterioposterior nomenclature for making measurements (diametre just one end to another)

(for long bone) epishysis fused, so adult (adult/child distinguish)

tooth present for age, sutures fused, tooth decay
upper molars tend to have 3 roots
tip of root angled towards the back
3rd molar erupts at 18
will be given formula, know how to obtain values
