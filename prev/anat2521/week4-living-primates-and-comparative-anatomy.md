# Week 4 - Living Primates and Comparative Anatomy
Suborders:
  1. Strepsirhini/Prosimian:
     Clingers and leapers. Have rhinarium, i.e. wet nose
     Lemurs had no natural predator in Madagascar, so example of adaptive radiation
     Lorises very slow-moving, huge eyes
  2. Haplorhini/Anthropoid:
     Tarsiers (traits mix of strepsirhines and haplorhines)

     New World monkeys. Prehensile tail, platyrrhini: outward facing nose (3 premolars)
     Marmosets and tamarins
     Old World monkeys. catarrhini. Ischial callosites (tissue padding on sitting bone, i.e. ischial tuberosity) 
     Macaques and baboons

     Catarrhini/homoinoidea/apes:
     hylobatidae (lesser apes): gibbons (borneo, asia)
     hominidae (knuckle walkers): oraguntans (solitary)
       hominiae: gorrillas (mountain gorillas almost extinct)
       hominini: chimps (central africa) 
       Will live in groups and play roles based on personality, learn culture i.e. tool-making
       bonobos (hypersexual, strong female bonds)
      
       Humans (bipedalism, most generalised digestive system, enhanced cognitive abilities, culture dependence, verbal/written speech)


For most animals, behaviour is largely determined by evolutionary history of their genetics. 
e.g. cats play with mice as they evolved as predators, horses as prey 
behaviours have evolved through natural selection, i.e. behaviour is a phenotype
our evolution has been shaped by the ecological setting of our ancestors

Compared to other mammals, primates very generalised.
Many of these traits evolved because of their use in ancestral arboreal living.
This generalisation is most evident in the haplorhines:
* Limbs and Locomotion:
  - erect posture
  - flexible/generalised limbs for varied locomotion
  - prehensile hands and feet (opposable thumbs meaning they can move independently) 
  - nails over claws 
  - brachiation (arm swinging from branch to branch)
* Diet and Dentition:
  - omnivorous (good if one source runs out, however increased competition from other species) 
  - heterodonty (flat cusps in molars, no enormous canines for tearing meat, no enormous molars for fibrous foods)
* Brain
  - stereoscopic vision (closer eyes less range of vision, but better depth and colour perception), 
  - skull protection of eye
  - enhanced colour vision, reduced olfactory, bony protection of eyes
  - enhanced neocortex for sensory processing
  - encephelisation
* Maturation
  - enhanced fetal nourishment
  - reliance of derived learning with extended ontology
  - social groups with common presence of adults
  - diurnal
  - k-selected


primates closed eye socket (in reference to the side)
early primates develop vision for catching insects

quadrapedal, same proportions in limbs

almost all nonhuman primates are critically endangered due to deforestation, hunting and trade

as in general, larger animals have less surface area relative to body weight 
they lose heat less quickly and therefore eat relatively less, 
e.g. 2 40kg people eat more than 1 80kg person.
similarly, lower body weight the higher the BMR (basal metabolic rate), 
so require higher caloric foods

food distribution is abundant and dense: large communities (leaves). 
scattered: small (insects, fruits)

shorter life span better for unpredictable environment as faster maturation rate

if prey, large groups better. this is the main reason why humans live in groups
so, it makes sense that our behaviour should reinforce the integrity of the group

primates have dominance hierarchies (decreases chance of violence)
as living in social setting, communication is an essential part 
(scents, gestures, grunts, autonomic, e.g. blushing)
violence is typically seen in response to lack of food or access to mates
many acts of appeasement/bonding are through physical contact 
(grooming being the most important)
principle benefits of aggression are protection and territorial expansion to get more food and mates

competition for mates is high for males, so want to reproduce as much as possible to pass on their genes, i.e. have a higher reproductive fitness
(infanticidal is an example of this, as killing children allows the mother to care your children)

k-selected, i.e. produce a small number of offspring (primates single offspring), but invest large amounts of effort into it (as oppose to r-selected like fish)
therefore, mammals suited for stable environments

the lack of sexual dimorphism is a good indicator of long-term monogamous bonds

modern humans have a very high encephilisation (brain larger than what is predicted based on our body-to-brain ratio)
the neocortex being the most recently developed part of the brain responsible for cognitive thinking comprises 80% of our brain.
our brains continue to grow outside the womb (unlike other primates), requiring significant energy (so must be evolutionary beneficial)

human language is distinct in that it's symbolic, i.e. refer to immaterial things, things in the past etc.

language is left hemisphere. left hemisphere controls motion of right body. left hemisphere is dominant in most people, so most people are right-handed

the cultural behaviour of great apes makes them interesting to understand early hominins?
they lived in areas similar to that of our ancestors, so we probably had similar behaviour?

many primates perform altruistic acts (most notably humans with empathy)

--------------------------
1. mammal and primate (different dental formula)
tell difference between ape and monkey skull

determine locomotion from bone ratio
size of orbits
strepssorhine have post orbital bar unlike in non-primate mammals
enclosure of orbits seen in haplorhines
why so large canines in herbivore? (sexual selection)
insectivore/leaf eater have more pointed cusps (bilophodant; use to identify Old World monkeys)
old world monkey teeth insectivore, so harsh ridges in molars
apes frugavores so more rounded molars
reduced saggital rudder in humans as less jaw mucles to have larger brain

all monkeys have ridged teeth for leaves side-to-side

diastema implies honing and sectorial premolar

chimps shorter lumbar due to less space tall pelvis

apes have longer arms than legs due to primordial brachiation
humans have longer legs
however, a clinger will have longer legs but will also have clinging feet


often look at chimps because of their closeness to us to understand early hominin life. does this mean that from our common ancestor, chimps have had less in-between species?

chimp behaviour used as hypothesis
eskeleton.org websites

is it because chimp behaviour determined by genetics to a greater extent?

how do you know if that trait is unique to chimps or shared?

so, if right-hemisphere is dominant in someone, they will be left-handeded? 
what about ambi-dextrous?

is nasal index narrow to broad?
questions about limb size variations in lab 3
how many dinosaur bones are real? how to tell?

if monkey having long tail that is not prehensile, what is the point? (balance?)

where is petrosal bulla (unique to primates, inner ear for balance)?

Why do different human populations (past and present) display differences in platymeric index? (thickness of femur?)
different stresses acted on body due to lifestyle

Why do people with different geographical ancestry differ in the shape of their heads/skulls?
shape of nose here
