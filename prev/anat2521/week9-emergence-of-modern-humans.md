# Week 9 - Emergence of Modern Humans
3.3mya-300ka: Lower Paleolithic - Early Stone Age
300-50ka: Middle Paleolithic - Middle Stone Age - prepared core (Levallois)
50-10ka: Upper Paleolithic - Late Stone Age 
Time of rapid pace of behavioural change; tools; symbology
Starting of blade technology, microliths (arrow heads)

Modern humans:
1. 200ka: Africa (Omo, Ethopia) 
2. 100ka: Middle East (Skhul & Qafzeh, Israel)
Oldest deliberate burial of Homo sapiens
Coincided with Neandanthals in different climates
3. 40ka: Asia (Tianyuan Cave, China) 
Earlier agreed upon evidence expected to be found 
4. 50ka: Australia (Lake Mungo, Australia)
Required boats to travel across Wallace's line (Sunda and Sahul)
5. 40ka: Europe (Oase Cave, Romania)
Aurignacian culture 
Neandartals soon disappear after first modern humans and interbreeding
5. 30ka: New World (Monte Verde, Chile)
Clovis culture
Via Bering land bridge
6. 3ka: Polynesia (New Zealand -> Easter Island -> Hawaii)
From Phillipines and Taiwan 
Lapita culture

Modernity:
Possible first signs from Erectus making practically too big Acheuluan stone tools
1. 160ka: Pinnacle Point, South Africa (eating seafood, mixing ochre rituals)
2. 70ka: Blombos Cave, South Africa (shell beads/necklaces, ochre ingraving)  
3. 64ka: Altamira Cave, Spain (oldest cave painting) 
4. 44ka: Borneo, Indonesia (oldest storytelling art)
5. 40ka: Australia (grave goods, possible belief in afterlife)
6. teeth modification (jade inlays)

Seafood diet adapted in modern humans. 
Due to stable food source provided during glacial maxima

Art introduced as a means of establishing group identity and whether friend or foe 
(cave art petroglyphs, ornaments)

Inconclusive findings could be only tools found with no DNA or human remains

Splitter view, out-of-africa also known as replacement model?
Who used Levallois?
Name origin of homo sapien (knowledge)?
