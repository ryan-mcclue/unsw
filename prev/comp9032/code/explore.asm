; IMPORTANT(Ryan): As the name implies, PUSH will put data at the next address to what the SP currently is at.
; POP will take value at current SP

; WinAVR a possible calling convention

; Stack pointer is a I/O register
; Seems we can access first 64 I/O with IN/OUT 1byte addresses (faster?). 
; Or can access all (64 + 416) with ST/LD 2byte addresses? Use ST/LD for SRAM access as well?

; TODO(Ryan): Pass parameters as registers. Then inside function assign parameters to stack and reuse those registers?
; If we treat everything as a function, then never have to save registers assuming stack size isn't an issue?
; The registers we use here are call-clobbered

; However can just do simple if we know not using large number of registers

; IMPORTANT(Ryan): Function call
function:
; 1. SAVE STACK FRAME POINTER 
  push YL
  push YH
; 2.1 SETUP STACK FRAME
  rcall . ; equivalent to pushing 2 bytes
  push 0
  in YL, SPL
  in YH, SPH
; 2.2 SETUP STACK FRAME
  in YL, SPL
  in YH, SPH
  sbiw YH:YL, 3  
  out SPL, YL
  out SPH, YH
; 3. LOAD PARAMETERS ONTO STACK
  std Y+3, r16
  std Y+4, r17
; 4. ASSIGN LOCAL VARIABLES
  ldi r24, lo(10)
  std Y+1, r24 
  ldi r24, lo(20)
  std Y+2, r24 
; 5.1 CLEANUP STACK FRAME
  pop 0
  pop 0
  pop 0
  pop YH
  pop YL
; 5.2 CLEANUP STACK FRAME
  adiw Y, 8
  out SPL, YL
  out SPH, YH
  pop YH
  pop YL
; 6. RETURN
  ret


; IMPORTANT(Ryan): Will have particular compares for signed and unsigned
; multiplication output goes to multiple registers

.def sum_i=r18
.def sum=r19

; IMPORTANT(Ryan): So, 16bit address space.
; Unique to program memory is that it's arranged with 'word addresses', i.e. each address holds 16bits (in contrast to normal byte addresses)
; We pass in say 0x0000 as a byte address, but must convert to word-address equivalent, i.e. addr*2, addr*2+1
; so, special address semantics when working with program memory

; interesting status register storage bit

  ; IMPORTANT(Ryan): signed subtraction vs subtraction just means
