1. Disruption of nature:

2. man's hubris:

3. emotional isolation:

initial opening 'look to the stars for the promise of progress', 
implying lack of connection with the current world (things have stagnated) 
and desire to start fresh rather than reflect and repair.

opening monologue is very telling of disconnect: 
'I'm focused on the essential to the exclusion of all else'; 
to be instrument of progress you must disregard all else 'space makes sense'
head cast down shutting of an emotional connection. 
he is giving a psychological assessment that is evaluated by a machine
'I see myself from the outside'; 'it's all a performance'; 'just don't touch me' 
to maintain his anemic state he must refrain from all emotional responses
falling from the ISS, maintains an unnatural level of calm; 
cannot maintain relationships, 'she said I had a self-destructive side'; 
'i should feel something'
they value his pulse not going above 80, 
rather than care for his well-being or what that really represents 
(i.e. he has no emotional response and his most likely depressed)

when asked how he handled his father's absence he only mentions how it affected his mother; 
he can only describe emotions by relating how they are experienced in others

when discussing Lima project, surrounding officials only concerned with recording information 
rather than offering guidance/support; 

you must live by a collective rule and deal with your humanity on your own; 'are you with us?'
when talking about his father's disapperance and childhood absence 'that was that'
colonel talking to roy 'voyage of exploration can be used as an escape'; 
no realisation of what the implications mean for Roy in that his father did not want to see him again. 
his father promised to come back and take Roy with him
frequent close-ups to Roy's eyes; this is how he experiences emotion; no physical response
such isolation means Roy cannot maintain outside relationships and is Roy very self-critical
'i have made many mistakes in life'; unable/struggles to leave voice message for Eve

before mars mission; ever constant psyhcological evaluation 
to ensure higher-ups always have control
'the moon. where the world comes together' despite disputed territories in a state of war; 

trying to create a false sense of reality to reaffirm the supposed positives of what they are doing
concerning the colonel 'why can't he let go?'; 
roy asks himself theses questions as it's not in his nature to discuss emotional questions with another person in the open
colonel injured 'colonel you have an irregular heartbeat; i suggest you get that checked out'; 
no asking how he is. it's all about information processing; no emotion
mood stabliser pills.
ever repeating Roy voice-over to emphasis his lonliness/isolation.
onboard to mars the contrast between Roy and and the other crew members laughing and getting along.
many people discussing Roy's father are full of adulation and praise; 
this furthers Roy's image of himself as second-rate in the eyes of his father. 
he is always referred to as 'son of william mcbride'

normal chain of command Roy is constantly in a submissive state being told what to do; 
even on trip to Mars his lower-ranked Captain does not adhere to his requests to ignore Mayday
the psychological evaluation following the monkey attack, Roy tells of his rage similar to that of monkey; 
if he compartmentalises this anger he experiences pain; 
it's still approved however; as long as he is able to perform optimally this is what is important, regardless of his unhealthy mental state
after arriving at Mars underground base '7 weeks since Sun, birds, trees'; 
to search onward you must absolve yourself from nature.
rooms with virtual nature scenes projected onto the walls
all the bases are neutral colour schemes, 
dim lighting, basic shapes like cubes; furnished with only the essential; purely functional

after laser transmission, Roy realises he is being used; 
the trauma of the individual is outweighed by the collective good which is determined 
a by a small few
after emotional plea to his father, still no emotional condolences; instead his purpose has been exhausted and he is discarded
failed psyhchological assessment places you in a comfort room; no human contact; tranquility is supposed to be achevied through oneself alone
layers of deception and censoring to preserve image; his father was not a hero
'i'm being pulled farther and farther from the Sun to you', the Sun representing goodness and happiness; 
in order to reach his father Roy is being pulled further from his humanity

such emotional anemia enables and individual to perform seemingly inhuman actions, 
e.g. his father killing the mutineers and Roy so desired to ignore orders as he believes he knows best and has nothing else in his life t hat matters
Eve saying 'even when your hear I don't know where you are'. no scenes are with him and Eve in person in the present time (in fact all of this close relations are portrayed in this fashion)
enroute to Neptune, Roy experiences negative effects of 0g on both psychological and physical self 
(psychodelic hallucinations, trance states of past memories, focusing on the negative things he has done with relationships, 
repeating phrases, hearing voices); repetive and monotonous task of long space journeys
humans require variety in order to survive
reliance on technology can blunt independence, e.g. the Captain unable to operate in manual control when landing on Mars
soundtrack often monotnous to reinforce dreary life 
TODO: what is the anti-matter catalyst on the Lima project. is it source of energy?
the blind pursuit of a goal deterioates your humanity
even after the most crushing statement to him 'i never once thought of home. i never cared about you or your mother and your small ideas'. 
conditioned to just have a tear slowly slide from his eye
his father recognised to discover the wonders of the universe you have to abandon all else; SpaceComm embraces this mentality 
Roy's emotional anaemia continues when communicating with his father
only after he witnesses his father fade away in space does Roy exert a physical emotional response and cries out. the threshold for emotional experiences is so high
the severe sacrifices required to search beyond left Roy's father with no desire to live in the real world. 
'could only see what wasn't there, not what was right in front of him' imbued with such a will to achieve a goal, things that don't satisfy this are discarded at the detriment of oneself
