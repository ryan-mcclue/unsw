1. Disruption of nature:

2. man's hubris:

3. emotional isolation:


opening credits black-and-white devoid of life. despondent, whirring noise indicating that there is life but no emotion
retirement not execution to dehumanise replicants
opening panning shot of dark, polluted sky covered with industrial buildings. 
no greenery, all artificial light. 
streets crowded with people, buzzing with noise like a collective unit (chasing stripper)
tyrell corporation building is like a pyramid, towering above all others, 
elevating to a god-like status 
tyrell interviewer is dismissive of subjects emotions like 
mentioning he is nervous or distressed. in fact seems to relish making him uncomfortable
similarly, deckard telling rachel she is a replicant is at first very awkward and uncomforting 
relaying information that is emotionally sensitive; 
almost as if the caring nature in humans is not typical
furthermore, when deckard forces rachel to kiss him he again demonstrates a lack of humanity
tannoy system 'start a again on the off-world colony'; 
resignation that current climate is terrible
even the police station is dirty, unkempt. only tyrell is clean
creation of origami is attempt to recreate life
'if your not police your little people' controlling you into submission
4-year life span is failsafe; disregard their ability to develop emotion; refer to as 'skinjobs', 'it', 'them'. rachel is just an experiment to control them better etc.
asking 'do you like our owl?', immediate response is 'is it artificial?; of course' 
the idea of something natural is unheard of. genetically engineer eyes, snakes, etc.
tyrells office the only place that gets the sun, voices echo to make you feel insignificant. 
his glasses flicker with light
grand buildings that lie in rubbish-strewn streets
ship flying overhead is almost like big-brother; 
spotlights constantly filtering through windows to indicate a sort of automated intrusion; 
no peace and quiet
J.F sebastian says 'i make my friends'; 
only one who seems content in the world is one who has given in to the idea of human replacements
deckard frequently drinking, also at police station; coca cola adverts are displayed a lot; smoking also; all to cope with living in such a dreary place
no concern for deckard after seeing him distressed after killing. all duty
majority of soundtrack is electronic music, symbolising that computers are present in all facets of life
deckard has no social life or friends
the replicants display more emotion than humans; distress at loss of others, anger at prospect of being destroyed, joy when seeing others, amusement at being playful and enjoyment with their plans working (chess ruse)
they are in some way more human in that they are learning to cope with their emotions, whilst humans have learned to stow them away.
Roy repeating 'not yet' in the face of death; he shows a desire to keep living
camera constantly panning up to indicate insignificance of human occupants. 
the nexus replicants each represent attributes of humanity that has been lost, 
i.e. we have to experience these emotions through them as we have lost them ourselves
e.g. pris is movement, roy cunning/devious, rachel caring, leon follower, zora flirtatious 
the noticeable distress in deckard as he kills the replicants is due to the society he lives in not offering ways to express emotions, 
so he experiences physical shakes instead
the extreme uneasiness he feels to Roy when he chases him as Roy embraces animalistic (howling) traits (and masochistic in order to prolong life), 
emotions Deckard is not accustomed to witnessing
deckards understanding of the loss of his humanity is most pointantly experienced when he is saved by Roy (he was trying to be free, 
the most basic human emotion, not malice) and then witnesses Roy dying and how insigthful and introspective he is; 
what world must he live in whereby these 'human' replicants are treated with such disrespect
'it's too bad show won't live, then again who does?' remarking on the drudgery life has become
