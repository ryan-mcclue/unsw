Discusses both societal factors and scientific understanding

question/topic - overly broad, unclear
resources - minimal resources identified
form - not clearly described

1.
'AI and technology in future'

To increase the number of resources mentioned to 4, could reference:
* Blade Runner, 1982 movie. Details a dystopian future where human-like androids, a.k.a 'Replicants' exist and all life such as animals are artificial.
* I, Robot, 2004 movie. Details a future where humanoid robots serve humanity in almost every aspect of life.

question/topic:
An essay presents an argument and provides reasoning to back this up.
Your thesis does not outline an argument that you are intending to persuade the reader into thinking.
It's very open-ended.  Your project is in the form of a discussion rather than an essay.
It's important to keep this distinction in mind when you write, as you don't want to bias a particular point of view.

An interesting point of discussion may be to explore how the motivations for technological advances influence their outcomes.
e.g. does developing cybernetics for military purposes result in better/worse outcomes than if developed for better quality of life?

2.
'can humanity as we know it thrive in space'

To increase the number of resources mentioned to 4 and to explore different group sizes of humans living in outer space could reference:
* Lost in Space, 2018 TV series. Explores how a family attempts to survive in outer space.
* The Martian, 2015 move. Explores how an individual attempts to survive in outer space.

question/topic:
Remember to make the distinction between each text's context/motivation for moving outer space.
This is important, as it affects the resources put into the mission and the psychology of those involved.
Therefore, whether the outcome of any is negative, it's worth mentioning that if a similar mission with different motivations was taken, the outcome might have been different. 

Outline the specific traits of what you think constitutes "humans of today", e.g. humans physical makeup, modern social structures etc.
Relate to to these specifics instead of such a general term.

As you mention your engineering background, make sure to also discuss societal factors as well as factors relating to the physical environments.

3.
'war between humans and aliens'

To increase the number of resources mentioned to 4 and to explore the consequences of war at different levels of society, could reference:
* Iron Man 3, 2013 movie. Offers insight into the consequences of war on an individual who suffers from PTSD and anxiety.
* War of the Worlds, 2005 movie. Offers insight into the consequences of war on a family.

question/topic:
War itself is not directly related to the course. 
Its effect on society could be considered a non-scientific discussion.
Make sure to mention scientific/technological developments made as a result of war and their negative consquences.
This will ensure you stay relevent to the course, which is a science based course not a humanities one.

form:
You have a paragraph dedicated to the benefits of war but none to the negatives of war which is what you are arguing. 
Consider putting at least an equal amount of writing arguing in favour of your thesis.

In order to make clear that your thesis is related to your degree or personal interests, try and inject an element of personalisation in your writing, e.g. I have seen this in my experience of ...
