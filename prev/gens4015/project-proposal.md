# GENS4015 Project Proposal
Of the five prescribed novels, I have chosen *The Forever War*, Joe Haldeman.
As my two supporting materials, I have chosen *Ad Astra*, 2019 film directed by James Gray and *Blade Runner*, 1982 film directed by Ridley Scott.
The thesis of my project is: **The pursuit of scientific advancements challenges what it means to be human**
My project will take the form of a persuasive essay.
In support of my thesis, I will discuss these topics:
## The Forever War:
Scientific advancements are pursued in order to help win the war with the Taurans
1. Disruption of Nature:
  * Extreme pychological manipulation and mind conditioning to alter natural thought processes.
    Soldiers have  their sense of empathy overridden in order to evoke intense hatred for the Taurans in battle.
    General population is controlled towards homosexuality in order to control birth rates. Heterosexuality viewed as sociopathic.
  * No natural births. No concept of a parent. Adolescent years spent in an institution.
    Eugenics council controls all production of life, ensuring everyone has similar traits. 
    Eventually everyone is a clone.
  * All interactions dominated by computers and machinery (at their mercy)
    Spaceships and major weapons are almost exclusively controlled by a computer. 
    Physical acts like running and walking overriden by enhanced space suit.
    Education controlled with automated learning systems.
2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Extreme time dilation makes it impossible to maintain social bonds outside of the Army.
    Army deliberately moves squad members around to prevent developing relationships.
    Forced to to 'sack' (have sex) with members of your squad every night.
    Emotions are reduced to physical releases that you don't become attuned with.
  * Desensitisation to death and suffering.
    The idea of a private dying in training or later on a mission is commonplace and underwhelming.
    On Earth, medical priority levels so only certain individuals get treatment.
    Individualism is discarded. Only duty and results matter.
## Ad Astra:
Scientific advancements are pursued in order to develop interstellar travel and knowledge of life in the universe 
1. Man's Hubris:
  * Media censorship and propaganda rife in Space Force and on Earth. 
    The few in command believe they know what's best for everyone to acheive a better society.
    Roy is told lies about his father so that he is still motivated to continue work
  * Clifford's vanity meant he was in strong alignment with Space Force's message and so was selected as leader for the Lima project.
    He was the figurehead of Space Force excellence, promoting others to adopt his excessive self assurance in order to succeed 
    Even mild-mannered Roy adopts this mindset, as he illegally boards the ship to Neptune, thinking only he can get the job done
2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Roy's complete lack of emotional responses is valued by Space Force, e.g. his pulse never going above 80 is commended.
    Roy's frequent voice-overs, closeup shots and relationship flashbacks further emphasis his emotional anaemia
    Room interiors are all muted colours. Soundtrack is monotonous and steady.
  * Psychological assessments are performed by a machine asking questions and subject speaking into an microphone.
    A repeated phrase to ensure passing is "I'm focused on the essential to the exclusion of all else" 
    On failure, you enter a solitary 'comfort room'. No human contact or emotional discussions. 
## Blade Runner:
Scientific advancements are pursued in order to develop synthetic intelligent life
1. Disruption of Nature:
  * Shots of environment show excessive pollution, towering machinery, dirty streets, dark mottled skies and no trees or greenery.
    No natural light. All animals are artifical, epitomised with the existence of the Replicants.
    Soundtrack uses digital synthesisers, no physical instruments.
    Engineers now manufacturer body parts instead of doctors treating individuals.
2. Emotional Isolation:
  * Deckard is portrayed as a loner. No scenes of him in a social setting, all work.
    Deckard's work colleagues show no concern for his wellbeing.
    Deckard himself is awkward and uncomforting relaying emotional information.
    When Deckard is subject to an event of high emotional impact, he undergoes physical shakes instead of healthy emotional expressions. 
  * Disregarding their ability to develop emotion, builtin to the Replicants is a '4 year fail-safe' that will shut them down after 4 years.
    Non-complying Replicants are sought for termination, not execution. This choice of words, along with slurs like 'skinjob' serves to dehumanise them.
    The Replicants exhibit varied emotions such as compassion, fear, anger and a desire to live.
    The Replicants emotions serve as a dichotomy to humanity's lack thereof.
