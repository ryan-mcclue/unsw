# GENS4015 Reflection
It was suggested that I make the link between what topics I discuss in my texts and how they relate to my thesis clearer.
**Tutor:** "Be careful you don't end up doing just a critique on the text itself but that you keep it relevant to your topic"
**Peer:** "It's important not to forget what you are trying to prove with your thesis".
In line with this, I provide a definition that I will refer back to in my paragraphs to stay on topic.
*What it currently means to be human is to interact with nature, be in touch with your emotions and to be modest.*

It was also noted that I need to specifically mention the particular scientific/technological advancements that have allowed the topics I discuss to be possible.
**Tutor:** "Make sure to include scientific and technological discussion rather than just talking about societal effects!"
**Peer:** "Mindful of not skipping over the scientific advancements discussion".
To pinpoint the particular advancement used, I had to investigate the current state of knowledge in various branches of science.
In addition to the content of my original project proposal, I have included these specific advancements (some may be shared between texts, however I only mention unique ones):

## The Forever War:
  * Advancements in neuroscience have allowed for extreme pychological manipulation and mind conditioning.
    The ability to selectively reinforce or destroy the electrical connections between the neurons and synapses in our brains allows for thought control.
  * Advancements in biology have allowed for no natural births.
    An egg is artificially fertilised with sperm and then introduced to an artificial womb.
  * Advancements in genetic engineering have allowed for ensuring everyone has similar traits.
    This is acheived by altering the genomes of living organisms.
  * Advancements in computing have allowed for computers to control most aspects of life.
    The reduction in size of transistors and memory cells allows for improved computational power by being able to fit more onto a piece of silicon.
  * Advancements in aerospace-engineering have allowed for spaceships to travel at speeds close to the speed of light.
    Propulsion systems capable of sustaining the energy required to travel so fast, as well as technology to aid humans surviving high-g environments to accelerate to this speed in short amount of time.
## Ad Astra:
  * Advancements in aerospace-engineering have allowed humans to spend a large amount of time in space.
    Improved cosmic radiation protection and technology to inhibit the negative affects of prolonged exposure to microgravity (such as electric muscle stimulants)
  * Advancements in neuroscience have allowed the ability to reliably determine someone's mood/emotion from sensor readings.
    Detecting variations in a person's vital signs, vocal tones, pupil activity, body language etc.
## Blade Runner:
  * Advancements in robotics have allowed for fluid, human-like movements to be performed by robots.
    Improvements in multiple feedback loop systems to create agents that have a centre of gravity that changes as they move.
  * Advancements in artificial intelligence have allowed for agents to learn and adapt to complex and unpredictable situations.
    An increase in speed of machine learning algorithms used greatly decreases the time taken for an agent to make an informed decision.
  * Advancements in bio-engineering have allowed for the ability to grow artificial organs.
    Stem cells can be grown on scaffolds specific to the particular organ desired.
