1. Disruption of nature:
Although the seeming wonders of space travel, 
to deal with the difficulties of space travel and dangers on other planets, 
resort to harmful substances, e.g. weed and cigaretes rampant.

Also human enhancements like enhanced weight bearing suits, 
automatic guns further the disconnect with our natural self.

Extreme pychological manipulation to evoke hatred for the Taurans 
and to overcome our humanity to achieve particular tasks 
(good things get better, bad things get worse)

Furthermore, the 'military law' to have sex with different people 
every night loses the emotional bonds of being human, 
and such 'human' sensations are seen as necessities and just physical releases

Effects of mind conditioning with widespread gays and lesbians. Convenience over love

Unceremonious 'want to sack tonight?'
Found optimal build/ethinicity type for most humans: polynesian. 
Eugenics council to control virtually every aspect of ones life.
ALSC machine to indoctrinate memories that cannot be forgotten. 
The same immoral principles have more 'civilised' ways of being inflicted

No natural births. Conscription for all. Young years spent in an institute 'creche'. 
Certain 'normal' traits considered sociopathic

2. man's hubris:
Quick to pass judgement on Taurans knowing what they are capable of
Although no understanding, the development of interstellar travel 
has made more fearful of prospective threats, e.g. taurans with a returned drone attack 
Lack of empathy/desensitised with knowledge of such destruction and frequent death 
(the idea of dying in training is just commonplace). 
First instinct to kill animals, capital punishment (no patience), 
destroy buildings (even inanimate objects are subject to this ideology)
UN organises everything; intense globalisation. 
this utmost control can stifle individualism; 
they control employment and dictate how you live your life (everything short of a dictatorship). 
censor media, seriously not even subtle distorted and fake news
Deception saying you could choose your assignment but no garuntee how long you'd have that, i.e. reassigned immediately
UN conditioning people to not want to live in large houses but small places. 
UN charging insane $5000 tax on $100 letter from Luna to Earth to discourage contact.
Medical priority levels of who is deemed suitable for medical treatment. 
No empathy from nurses. No empathy from crematorium.
No care for individuals, separating people to different time dilations in order to further reinforce staying in the army

3. emotional isolation:
time dilation causing alienation (called queer)
humans only required where technology won't work
loss of enjoyments, care-free living, everything is duty
after not admitting to cowardice: 'surely he had nothing so primitive and unmilitary as a will to live'
Mind conditioning makes you doubtful if your own thoughts are genuine, particularly in times of distress, (amputation realisation)

## Private Mandella
Youthful cyninism/ignorance (questioning what is the point)
Collapsar is worm hole. High IQ individuals protect planets around collapsars, i.e. portal planets
Although no understanding, the development of interstellar travel has made more fearful of prospective threats, e.g. taurans with a returned drone attack 
Although the seeming wonders of space travel, to deal with the difficulties of space travel and dangers on other planets, resort to harmful substances, e.g. weed and cigaretes rampant.
Also, although capable, it will always be extremely dangerous to do this; travel and then suit-wearing on the planet, etc.
also loss of enjoyments, care-free living.
Quick to pass judgement on Taurans knowing what they are capable of
Lack of empathy/desensitised with knowledge of such destruction and frequent death (the idea of dying in training is just commonplace). 
First instinct to kill animals, capital punishment (no patience), destroy buildings (even inanimate objects are subject to this ideology)
Also human enhancements like enhanced weight bearing suits, automatic guns further the disconnect with our natural self.
Immense reliance on technology far too complicated for one person to understand (ships are landed via computer)
Immense investment and distances traversed, people easily become expendable commodites
prolonged time away from the norm can cause the loss of your humanity (they start caring, helping the man with the suit but later lose this as demonstrated by the more seasoned veterans)
Furthermore, the 'military law' to have sex with different people every night loses the emotional bonds of being human, and such 'human' sensations are seen as necessities and just physical releases
The high-risk endeavours of space travel involves high pressure situations where the slightest error can cause death. Serious affect on mental health
Extreme pychological manipulation to evoke hatred for the Taurans and to overcome our humanity to achieve particular tasks (good things get better, bad things get worse)
Lack of doing things for enjoyment, e.g. 'soyashit' a high concentrated foodstuff

## Sergeant Mandella
Harmful effects of 'over-zealous hate conditioning'.
Uneasiness with being at the mercy of a computer
Feeling of detachment (remarking on the inability to send messages faster than the speed of light). generational loss of knowledge
'future shock' term is mentioned, yet it still happens.
after not admitting to cowardice: 'surely he had nothing so primitive and unmilitary as a will to live'
after discussing marygay injuries: 'tried to make love'
mentioning of uneasniness with pyschological conditioning having unknown motives to the participants
served 20 years, only 25
the future holds mass unemployment, 75% on welfare. giant mega-cities
'mother passed around joints'; so casually
UN organises everythin; intense globalisation. this utmost control can stifle individualism; they control employment and dictate how you live your life (everything short of a dictatorship). 
censor media, seriously not even subtle distorted and fake news
The entire city 'brain' in a single small room. Such influence in such a small area.
UN conditioning people to not want to live in large houses but small places. UN charging insane $5000 tax on $100 letter from Luna to Earth to discourage contact.
Medical priority levels of who is deemed suitable for medical treatment. 
No empathy from nurses. No empathy from crematorium.
To go to 'Luna' to be more 'individual' have to rejoin UNEF.
Deception saying you could choose your assignment but no garuntee how long you'd have that, i.e. reassigned immediately

All are just soldiers; even after going to Heaven, few people know who they are
Heaven charges exorbitant rates as it knows the soldiers have accumulated interest.
No care for individuals, separating people to different time dilations in order to further reinforce staying in the army

## Major Mandella
ALSC machine to indoctrinate memories that cannot be forgotten. The same immoral principles have more 'civilised' ways of being inflicted
No natural births. Conscription for all. Young years spent in an institute 'creche'. Certain 'normal' traits considered sociopathic
The liklihood of anyone surviving a combat role is virtually none.
Found optimal build/ethinicity type for most humans: polynesian. Eugenics council to control virtually every aspect of ones life.
At no point is an attempt at conversing/peacemaking with the Tauruns suggested.
