---------------------------------------------------------
The narrator in the Light Brigade undergoes a journey of self discovery. 
Their view of themselves as an independent thinker is challenged by the decisions they have made in relation to the war and their opinions of the 'aliens'.

The narrator's desire for self-assurance is revealed in the introduction when they attempt to position themselves as a martyr "What happened to all those people doesn’t compare to what I have to do."
This need to convince themselves of their good intentions is further reinforced when they explain their reason for joining the war.  They make a distinction between being motivated by 3rd party propaganda and first hand trauma "That’s what the networks say, and that’s what my CO says, but I’m here because they betrayed San Paulo."
Furthermore, phrases like "I'm a good soldier", "I'm not stupid" and "It wasn’t my fault" are indicative of the narrator's inner conflict.

The narrator's opinion of the aliens is initially one of disgust and anger. This is demonstrated with the absence of remorse when injuring the alien girl "I deal with it when bad things happen. So should she."
However, this apparent lack of empathy for the aliens is accompanied by a recurring memory of the event "I still hear her and her mom screaming sometimes." 
This almost PTSD symptom yet again highlights the subconscious battle the narrator is facing with their involvement in the war and their opinion of the aliens. 

The narrator's mindset begins to shift when they enter an almost neurotic state upon contemplating the experience of being converted to light "I was figuring things out. Things they didn't want us to understand"
Their role in the destruction of the northern hemisphere is the tipping point in the narrator's struggle of acceptance.
The narrator realises how they have let emotions overcome their skills of independent reasoning "It was my lie. My betrayal".
They no longer view the war as a necessity to combat evil.
They also appreciate they have succumbed to the corporate attempt at vilifying and dehumanising through the use of the word 'alien'.
They understand the 'aliens' are just free-thinkers that wanted to live their own lives away from the 'corporations'

---------------------------------------------------------

They are aware of the realities of their position, knowing their not entirely altruistic. A degree of modesty

Heroism inspired joining after witnessing alien destruction of a place close to them (the propaganda did not convince them)

Willing to ignore inner questioning to adhere to the mold of a traditionalist macho soldier

Frequent vulgarity indicates their incredulaty and unwillingess to delve into the subject further 

Lack of empathy dealing with alien girl after hitting her legs. However, her sub-conscious remains conflicted with the memory of them screaming recurring in her mind

Constant questioning to the reader is reflective of them earnestly trying to convince themselves and absolve guilt. 
Also reaffirmations like 'I'm a good soldier', 'I'm not stupid', 'it wasn’t my fault' to show that they weren't brainwashed into joining a senseless war. Very insecure

Reference to 'we are light' as a last resort to imply that they can't be the bad ones

Not trusting the shrink or anyone. Furthers their need to reaffirm that their way of individual thinking is correct

A degree of neurosism in 'I was figuring things out. Things they didn't want us to understand'

Later accept that they are responsible for the war. The huge destruction of the northern hemisphere realised there unfounded ways
They clarify the vilified term 'alien' as a free-thinker. They forgive the San Paulo incident 
They say 'It was my lie. My betrayal' referencing giving up on their principles of self-evalution and not going with the herd.
