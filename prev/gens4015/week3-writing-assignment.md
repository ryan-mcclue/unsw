Compare and contrast the difficulties in communication between humans and aliens:

In 'Tear Tracks', the difficulty in communicating between humans and aliens is largely due to cultural differences.
Through patience, open-mindedness and introspection, the text suggests that these difficulties can be overcome.
By embracing these differences, 'Tear Tracks' proposes that one can learn about the experience of suffering. 

From the beginning, Flur is uneasy with the emotional expressions of the Cyclopes "Flur finds each eye startlingly (perhaps deceptively?) expressive."
She expresses apprehension when inspecting the portraits of notable Cyclopes and struggles to coalesce what she is seeing with similar humans on Earth
"There are no confident smiles ... They look almost sorrowful ...  They look too sorrowful, the way the politicians at home look too distinguished"
These thoughts in Flur's mind are then realised in physical communication when Irnv introduces the President by casually reciting her misfortunes
"It’s the president ... She lost her three children and husband to sudden illness over the period of a year!"
Inrv's continued matter-of-fact introduction of the council members with such sorrow overcomes Flur "Unable to continue murmuring about how sorry she is, Flur is reduced to nodding along and trying not to wince"
The open discussion of a personal tragedy with a relative stranger is not a cultural custom on Earth.
This cultural difference causes Flur to misinterpret the Cyclopes body language as disinterested and greif stricken. 
"The president doesn’t seem engaged ... no one else is showing fire or passion either ... The president doesn’t seem up for it right now, with all she’s been through"
Later talking with Tsonga, Flur incorrectly applies Earth's cultural lens to the President's sorrowful disposition, remarking "It's a shame that we caught a weak leader" 
However, after Tsonga informs Flur of her misunderstanding "They believe that people who have suffered greatly have earned wisdom", Flur is propelled into deep introspection.
She thinks about how she has hidden her own greif "all the hardship and self-doubt she has so painstakingly camouflaged" and that it has left her vulnerable.
Drawing a parallel between her mother and Inrv's earlier description of the tear tracks in honour of the President "to represent her learning, sacrifice, and wisdom" Flur feels guilt for ignoring her mother's greif.
Flur realises that by embracing this pain, she could have explored a new avenue of personal development and in some way, not let her mother's sorrow be in vain.
Such a realisation is epitomised with the final line "In another world, it would be enough to make her president"

Comparatively in 'Deal', the difficulty in communicating between humans and aliens is largely due to differences in physical makeup.
Through perserverance, analysis and inquisitiveness, the text suggests that these difficulties can be overcome.
By embracing these differences, 'Deal' proposes that one can learn to better communicate emotional experiences.

The non-humanoid makeup of The Visitors is representative of the unknown. The degree to which this can affect communication is demonstrated with Kim's cowering reaction to the Visitor in the house.
"She had been close to tears, almost hyperventilating". Belulah remarks that she has seen Kim "carry a bark scorpion outside in one of her shoes", emphasising that Kim is not overly fearful to highlight the degree at which The Visitors can affect anyone.
The unfamiliarity with The Visitors appearance is extended to their language. 
The difficulty with emulating their speech is outlined when Belulah undergoes an exhaustive series of steps to practice speaking Visitor "humming while breathing in and out through her nose, a long rolled r, a voiced lateral fricative".
Belulah remarks that "she might as well be talking to an insect", to describe how unnatural the process feels. 
With such a disparate form of communication compared to humans, it is difficult to speak naturally and learn about the Visitors.
Belulah scrutinises The Visitors ability to encircle the Earth in a lattice despite it's positive effects in reducing UV exposure and global warming.
She see's The Visitors amazing capabilities but is unaware of their purpose on Earth. This leads to fearful conclusions involving humans feeling powerless "A cold finger draws itself down the length of her spine ... To not have the tools to ask that person why"
Belulah's perserverance in learning about the Visitors at *V110* causes her to draw a parallel between exploring how to communicate with The Visitor's and discussing Kim's cancer diagnosis "If Beulah can learn to talk to literal space aliens, maybe she can figure out why her girlfriend would rather get cancer than go to the doctor"
With this changed mentality, Belulah adapts her communication with Kim and is able to convince Kim to recieve treatment "This evening is Kim’s last laser treatment"
By reflecting on the communication environment between The Visitors and Earth, Belulah realises she can better understand and discuss human emotions.
