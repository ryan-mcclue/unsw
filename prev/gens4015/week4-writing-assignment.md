Aspects of habitability that are important but not included in the idea of the "habitable zone"? 
Feel free to discuss habitability for humans, Earth life, life in general, or all of the above.

# Weeky Writing Assignment 4 - The 'Habitable Zone'

As defined in the lecture slides, the 'habitable zone' is the orbital distance where a planet could have liquid water on its surface.
However, this definition does not take into account a number of complex factors such as habitability for humans, Earth life and life in general.

The term 'habitable zone' may include exoplanets with extreme environmental conditions that humans could not easily survive in.
There could be extreme volcanic activity on the planet's surface causing serious respiratory issues from gases such as sulphur dioxide and environmental damage from erupted materials.
A serious greenhouse effect may be present as touched on in *Sorry, 'Earth 2.0' Fans* "Does the presence of life influence the biosphere?" and *Colonize Mars?* "safeguard against polluting the red planet".
If this were the case, inevitable greenhouse gas emission could see planet temperatures skyrocket.
Furthermore, the planet could be entirely liquid water. In this situation, an almost infeasible amount of infrastruture would be required to support large numbers of humans. 

The term 'habitable zone' whilst offering the possibility of supporting life, does not offer the extent to which humans will be provided with sufficient social/mental/physical interactions like on Earth.
Humans are highly adaptive and embrace change.
It's highly possible that on a 'habitable zone' exoplanet, humans will have to live in close quarters with a small group of people due to the high cost of infrastructure required to get them there.
If we are restricted to living in space suits or inside of buildings for the rest of our lives we will lose the ability to engage with our environment.
The probable introduction of virtual reality systems and non-perishable foods to combat this repetitiveness may not offer approriate stimuli to an individual.
Consequences of this could be mental health issues such as depression.
Furthermore, personal clashes with individuals due to the high promixity to one another could become catastraphic if an appropriate means of resolution are not available.

The term 'habitable zone' is not specific as to what forms of life find the environment habitable.
On Earth, there are a variety of life forms that can survive under drastically different conditions than humans.
The Aquifex genus of bacteria can survive temperatures up to 96°C and the psychrophiles microbes can survive as low as -15°C.
A loriciferan of the genus Spinoloricus can survive without oxygen and the Deinococcus radiodurans bacterium can survive 1500 times more radiation than humans.
Furthermore, as remarked upon in *Sorry, 'Earth 2.0' Fans* "Hotter planets could have life thriving in their upper atmospheres; colder planets could have life thriving beneath a surface of ice"
Many of these lifeforms absorb water through the atmosphere and so the absence of liquid water does not render that environment uninhabitable for them.
