# Weeky Writing Assignment 7 - Tau Ceti-e Habitability
Tau Ceti-e is a real exoplanet that orbits the star Tau Ceti in the Cetus constellation.
Considering Tau Ceti-e's distance from Tau Ceti, its mass and the mass of the Tau Ceti, it lies outside the 'habitable zone'. 
However, as discussed in the week 3 lectures, the 'habitable zone' is a myopic determination of what is actually habitable.
Specifically, the term habitable must be qualified with certain conditions for a clear understanding of what is meant.
From *Sanctuary's* description of Tau Ceti-e, I believe that it's not habitable due to the presence of 'The Rot'.
It's described as a "native microorganism that feeds on substances derived from organic petrochemicals" and "breaks down anything made of these kinds of plastic".
Whilst humans can survive without plastics as evidenced by our hominin ancestors, the environmental conditions of Tau Ceti-e outlined in *Sanctuary* and the nature of space travel as we know it dictate the need for plastics.

The initial scans of Tau Ceti-e reveal a surface gravity of 1.59g. 
As this is higher than Earth's, some form of space suit would have to worn to prevent the negative effects of a high-g environment on the human body such as increased load on joints and blood pooling in feet, etc.
A suit with no plastics offers metal as a possibilty, however it's far too rigid and heavy. Similary natural fibres like cotton aren't rigid enough for protection on this scale.
Furthering the necessity of the spacesuit is Tau Ceti-e's atmosphere which is "thin but breathable". 
Although an extensive "period of physical development" could decrease resting heart rate to accomodate this, it's remarked that it could be "generation before humans are thoroughly acclimated to this world".
Therefore, for all intents and purposes the spacesuit's breathing apparatus is required.
Currently there is no technology that exists that could provide the same functionality as their plastic counterparts.
Consequently, I don't consider Tau Ceti-e to be habitable.

In order to survive the journey from Earth to Tau Ceti-e, the ship must be built to sustain certain environmental effects.
As discussed in week 5 lectures, the Sun emits the entire EM spectrum, most of which is dangerous to humans.
The ship must be built with the right materials to provide the same protection as Earth's magnetic field and ozone layer.
The downside of metal is its mass encumbering the ship, resulting in more energy being expended for propulsion.
One of the lightest metals, aluminium, does not offer enough protection against cosmic radiation as certain plastics.
Furthermore, plastics are an essential part of many other crucial components of a ship.
In order to soften the impact from extreme g-forces on acceleration and jolts when landing, very particular cushioning is required. These are comprised of plastics.
Medical equipment such as gloves, syringes, catheters and "plastic breathing tube" are all composed of plastic.
To provide power the ship will require electrical connections. These connections will typically have plastic insulation.
To have any meaningful functionality, the ship will require computers. Computers are comprised of printed circuit boards, which have plastic in them.
As a result, the only option available to those planning on inhabiting Tau Ceti-e would be to jettison the ship and never return. 
In any unforseen event or unplanned contingency which is highly likely due to the complicated nature of space travel, those on the planet's surface will be stranded and face death.
Such occurences are backed up in *Sanctuary*, e.g. failed detection of intelligent life, the Rot, etc. in previous probes.
With this in mind, I don't consider Tau Ceti-e to be habitable.
