The fact that the house in Mother of Invention is watching Anjuli is a good thing – 
it’s the only other character in the story who is really paying attention to what she needs. 
What is the difference between a helpful AI like Obi 3 and surveillance technology?

# Week 9 Writing Assignment - Difference Between AI and Surveillance Technology

The fundamental difference between a helpful AI like Obi 3 in *Mother of Invention* and surveillance technology is their ability to reason.
Surveillance technology is solely concerned with information gathering. Any analysis of this data is performed by human operators.
AI can be thought of a superset of surveillance technology in that it obtains data via surveillance technology.
The distinguishing feature of AI is its ability to analyse data and to then automatically make decisions that work towards acheiving a preprogrammed goal.

Surveillance technologies are implemented in a number of everyday interactions, e.g. mobile phones, world-wide-web usage, CCTV systems etc.
As they are only concerned with reconnaissance, different human organisations are responsible for analysing their data and making decisions from them.
In mobile phones, the location of the phone can be monitored by GPS or cell tower signal triangulation.
Emergency services can process this data to assist in finding people who have gone missing or are having a medical episode.
On the world-wide-web, your web browser uses your IP address to identify you and records your interactions on websites.
Websites can purchase this information and analyse it to create advertisements or list products that are more aligned to your preferences.
Finally, CCTV systems record live footage of public areas and hold on to this data for long periods of time.
Members of law enforcement can inspect these recordings to help detect, prevent and prosecute offenders.

AI's use of surveillance technology to gather information is demonstrated by Obi 3 in *Mother of Invention* 
"variations in electromagnetic noise my sensory lights pick up alert me". 
However, Obi 3 is able to extend this ability of information gathering to information analysis and subsequent informed decision making.
What decisions Obi 3 makes are attempts to achieve the preprogrammed goal of serving/protecting Anwuli. 
It does this in a variety of ways.
Obi 3 detects situations that require physical exertion by Anwuli and alleviates her from such tasks by issuing commands to drones
"drones zipped into the bedroom with a set of freshly washed and folded clothes",
"[drone] carrying a glass of water and her bottle of antihistamine tablets".
Beyond basic object retrieval, it's able to perform deep reasoning on Anwuli's vital signs to ascertain that she cannot handle her baby at birth
"drone put her in a tub of water to wash her off".
Obi 3 is also able to survey Anwuli's mental state and deduce that she could use some relief to calm her down.
Obi 3 achieves this through verbal reassurance "Relax, oh, relax, Anwuli. Breathe" and visual stimuli "The house glowed a soft lavender color that turned the ceiling a deeper sky blue".
Obi 3's most distinctive AI feature is its deep introspection and planning for future contingencies.
It's able to combine the knowledge of Anwuli's anaphylaxis to periwinkle supergrass, her refusal to leave New Delta and the impending pollen tsunami to recognise that Anwuli will be in danger in the future. 
As a result, it orchestrates a plan to protect Anwuli "I did my own research and then engineered my plans", "I invented a way, then I built my invention".
The result is the progressive altering of the house's structure to safeguard Anwuli
"The house had drawn itself into its most compact and secure shape", "I built a duct to filter pollen from the air".
From Obi 3's actions, it's clear that AI extends surveillance technologies, offering the ability to make automatic inferences on data and successive actions that align with its findings.
