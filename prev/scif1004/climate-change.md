global warming causes ice caps in greenland to melt into north atlantic and changes circulations which affects heat flow across the world

anthropegenic climate change

ocean affects climate

if you pass infrared through greenhouse gasses, they block them, 
but allow solar radiation (uv, visible light) to pass through.

greenhouse gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapour) are necessary to have the earth at a liveably warm temperature

short-term dips in historical temperature result from catastrophic volcanic eruptions block solar radiation

IMPORTANT: temperature triggers and then feedback cycles augment

ice-ages are triggered by orbits, e.g. eccentricity cycle of 100kyears, obliquity cycle; not CO2
then, sea ice melts causing less solar radiation to be reflected, so heating
futhermore, increasing heat of ocean causes it to release more CO2, enhancing greenhouse
so, whilst CO2 levels have fluctuated, never accelerated this fast or been at this level for millions of years 

reason countries of same latitude aren't same temperautre is because of currents (north atlantic/gulf stream)
so, if this current was disrupted, i.e. warm water not allowed to travel, then global cooling
e.g, glaciers melt (greenland 80%) and freshwater stops current

only ice sheets/glaciers(land) melting increase sea levels

sea levels can rise due to low pressure systems like cyclones over say warm water

when snow falls, traps air bubbles. ice forms, getting accumulation of trapped air

thermal expansion can cause sea levels to rise

1/3 of CO2 we release goes into ocean, causing acidification
plankton form calcium carbonate shelves

removing trees as made of carbon, will release into atmosphere

last ice age about 10kya

## Day After Tomorrow
speed and scale of ice formation off
so, mechanism right, timescale off
temperature of troposphere off
climate model would require supercomputer

to turn anecdotes into science, have to use statistics
