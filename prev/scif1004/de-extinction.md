put adult cell into egg cell of host organism with its nucleus removed to create hybrid embryo (however, the only dna is from cloning animal)
then put that embryo into surrogate to gestate, e.g. dinosaur into ostrich
prior to dolly, embryo splitting was used
the most difficult part of cloning is getting the donor somatic cell into the egg cell

dna half-life different to radioactive; refers to breakdown by environmental factors so not constant
however, theorised that 'dormant' dna is of our ancestors. so, birds have dna or dinosaurs in them

can actually clone with longevity

## Jurassic Park
find mosquito in tree sap
deals with neophobia, i.e scared of new things
all embryos are female initially, so deny hormone to turn them male
frog dna makes them haermaphodidic; life finds a way
velocioraptor portrayed as way too big
dinosaurs have some feathers, not all scaly
only mammals have diaphragms, so a dinosaur couldn't sneeze
most dinosaurs present are from cretaceous period
visible presentation not matching up with physical realities, e.g. poo to much, runs too fast
