yellow fever mosquito bourne; international vaccine for entry and rentry to certain countries
smallpox eventually develops into raised pustules that scar and internal organ failure
malaria is a parasite

virus has DNA and requires host to replicate. not considered living until in host. treated with antivirals
- killed or inactivated; to generate antibodies
- live attenuated virus, e.g. lesser cowpox protect against smallpox (stronger)
- subunit; only parts of virus that trigger immune response (safer, more efficient, more modern)
- mrna; only genetic code
could also perform passive immunisation by taking antibodies from someone previously recovered and inserting 

bacteria much larger and considered living as can self-replicate on own. treated with antibiotics that target bacteria functions

antibodies are proteins used to protect against antigens

antidote targets toxin directly rather than immune system

influenza (prefers birds) virus typically targets resipiratory; cold more head
(H) haemagglutin on surface of virus; aids in attaching to cell surfaces (various H's more conducive to various animal cells)
(N) neurainidase on surface of virus; release of virus onto host cells  
so, flus described say H5N1

immune system can overreact, e.g. allergic reaction

bringing back spanish flu from dead soldier in permafrost

mosquito very common virus vector 
bats better harbour of virus and mutation as only mammal that flies

## Outbreak
political, economical and technical issues associated with scientific issues
weaponising micro-organism/virus
convalescent serum only works early-on; won't work with a monkey as will treat cells as foreign
taking normal symptoms of ebola and hollywooding, e.g. organs exploding
explores what-ifs? e.g. smallpox stores in US and Russia stolen
think about human responsibility by bringing ourselves into contact with remote animals with viruses, e.g. bats

## Contagion
