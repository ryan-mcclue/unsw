# The Dangers of Science

**DISCUSS THE PORTRAYAL OF SCIENCE**

developments/progressions/

Scientific technologies have the potential to negatively influence many aspects of life.
In Ridley Scott's film *Blade Runner*, science is shown to be a force of evil. 
The film explores how the pursuit of scentific developments in the areas of bio-engineering, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI)
can have catastrophic results. 
These results are portrayed through the depiction of a society that is devoid of nature and emotionally isolated. 

In *Blade Runner*, scientific advancements are pursued in order to develop synthetic intelligent life.
These developments are negatively portrayed by presenting a society that is lacking natural life. 

Advancements in bio-engineering have allowed for the ability to grow artificial organs.
Stem cells can be grown on scaffolds specific to the particular organ desired.
Takes the idea of stem cells ...

The role of a conventional doctor has been replaced by a genetic designer as evidenced in the
scene with Hannibal Chew and the Replicants, where Chew remarks "I design your eyes".

Advancements in robotics have allowed for fluid, human-like movements to be performed by robots.
Improvements in multiple feedback loop systems are acheived, so as to create agents that have a 
changing centre of gravity.

Advancements in AI have ... 
chatgpt, dalle-2 etc. mode of expression

The accumulation of these The ability to emulate nature results in society devaluing the importance of natural things. This leads
to the removal of all things natural.



Wide angle shots of the environment show excessive pollution, towering machinery, 
dirty streets with no trees or greenery.
The majority of the movie is filmed in dark lighting with accompanying fog, which obscures any living details. 
A constant source of light are spotlights that filter through windows, following a sweeping pattern back and forth.
Their mechanical motion is disruptive and irritating, symbolising that the idea of light streaming in from outside, like the Sun naturally does, 
is an intrusion.
From this, we can see the vast deterioration of the natural world.
The soundtrack employs digital synthesisers with no physical instruments, demonstrating the extent to which even natural music has been replaced.
When Deckard asks Rachel about the composition of her owl "is it artificial?" her blunt response
"of course" demonstrates the dim resignation society has towards the natural being replaced.
It's clear that the scientific advancements in bio-engineering and robotics have disrupted nature by causing the replacement of natural things. 
They therefore challenge what it means to be human.

The scientific advancements prevalent throughout society in *Blade Runner*
create a civilisation that is emotionally isolated, thus challenging what it means to be human.
Advancements in artificial intelligence have allowed for agents to learn and adapt to complex 
and unpredictable situations.
An increase in the speed of machine learning algorithms used greatly decreases the time taken 
for an agent to make an informed decision.
As Replicants embody these advancements, synthetic life is able to develop emotion.
As the Replicant's are artificial, their emotional expressions are viewed as artificial by 
society also. The end result is a society that devalues the importance of emotion.
The opening of the film which describes the '4 year fail-safe' (termination) builtin to the 
Replicants is evident of society's disregard for their ability to develop emotion.
The dehumanising slurs to refer to the Replicants like 'skinjob' and 'skinner' serves to 
further enhance this state of affairs. 
Throughout the film, the Replicant's emotions serve as a dichotomy to humanity's lack thereof.
Roy expresses sorrow after the loss of Pris, Leon demonstrates devotion to the Replicant's plight
and Zora shows amorous desires in her work. 
Deckard's isolated, emotionally anemic life is symbolic of humanity. 
There are no scenes of him in a social setting, only work.
He is awkward and uncomforting relaying emotional information to Rachel.
When subject to an event of high emotional impact, such as when he shoots Zora or witnesses Roy's 
animalistic howling, he undergoes physical shakes instead of healthy emotional expressions. 
Even J.F Sebastian, the only human who shows any signs of happiness views emotions as a mechanical construct "I make my friends".
It's clear that scientific advancements in artificial intelligence have caused society to become emotionally isolated.
It therefore challenges what it means to be human.




In conclusion, *Blade Runner* portrays scientific technologies in bio-engineering, robotics and artificial intelligence as having harmful effects on society.
As a result of these technologies, society is shown to be disrupted from nature, emotionally devoid and self-centered.
Therefore, the film portrays science as a force of evil, warning of its catastrophic consequences if left unchecked.
