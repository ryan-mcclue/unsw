# The Dangers of Science

**DISCUSS THE PORTRAYAL OF SCIENCE**

developments/progressions/

Scientific technologies have the potential to negatively influence many aspects of life.
In the film *Blade Runner* (Ridley Scott, 2007), science is shown to be a force of evil. 
The film explores how the pursuit of scentific developments in the areas of bio-engineering,
cybernetics and artificial intelligence (AI) can have catastrophic results. 
These results are portrayed through the depiction of a society that is devoid of natural life and emotion. 

In *Blade Runner*, scientific progress is portrayed as a means to create synthetic life.
Such developments are shown to have a harmful effect on society by causing the removal of natural life. 
Progress in the field of bio-engineering is shown through the creation of synthetic organs.
Undifferentiated stem cells can be cultivated to differentiate into specific cell types based on the desired organ. (Ajmal, L. et al. 2023)
This science is highlighted by J.F Sebastian, where he remarks "Cause I do genetic design work" and by Dr Chew when he says "I design your eyes".
Advancements in cybernetics have allowed for the creation of agents that are physically superior to humans.
Powered orthosis is the process of adding energy to supporting plastic/metal that's molded to a limb to augment its function. (stanford)
This technology is evidenced where Tyrell states "More human than human is our motto" and when Inspector Bryant comments on the Replicants "They were designed to copy human beings in every way"
As a result of these innovations, society devalues natural things, which ultimately leads to their removal.

Wide angle shots of the environment show excessive pollution, towering machinery, dirty streets with no trees or greenery.
The majority of the movie is filmed in dark lighting with accompanying fog, which obscures any living details. 
A constant source of light are spotlights that filter through windows, following a sweeping pattern back and forth.
Their mechanical motion is disruptive and irritating, symbolising that the idea of light streaming in from outside, like the Sun naturally does, 
is an intrusion.
The soundtrack employs digital synthesisers with no physical instruments, demonstrating the extent to which even natural music has been replaced.
The presence of the bonsai tree and origami (natural) seem out of place.
An artificial owl and snake.

Scientific advancements in *Blade Runner* are also portrayed as allowing for the emulation of emotions.
The detrimental affects of these are demonstrated by presenting a society that has devalued the importance of emotion.
Developments in the field of AI are witnessed through the varied emotions and behaviours that the Replicant's exhibit.
With machine learning models using human electroencephalograms (EEGs) data, a psuedo emotional classifier can be trained that can imitate the way humans react (brunel)
Roy's ability to deliver an incredibly heartfelt monologue "All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain" is indicative of this technology.
The Replicant's versatility and adaptability is further evidence of additional AI innovations.
Large language models (LLMs) can be trained on custom data so they can learn about an individual and generate responses tailored specifically for them (replit)
A billboard advertising the Replicants with the text "Use your new friend as a personal body servant or a tireless field hand" shows their varied nature.
The emotions of the Replicants are contrasted with the absence of emotions in society.
As the Replicants are fundamentally artificial, emotions are therefore portrayed as artificial.

The opening black-and-white credits accompanied by digital synthesisers are devoid of colour and vitality. 

Even J.F Sebastian, the only human who shows any signs of happiness views emotions as a mechanical construct "I make my friends".

The opening of the film which describes the '4 year fail-safe' (termination) builtin to the 
Replicants is evident of society's disregard for their ability to develop emotion.
The dehumanising slurs to refer to the Replicants like 'skinjob' and 'skinner' serves to 
further enhance this state of affairs. 
Roy expresses sorrow after the loss of Pris, Leon demonstrates devotion to the Replicant's plight
and Zora shows amorous desires in her work. 
Deckard's isolated, emotionally anemic life is symbolic of humanity. 
There are no scenes of him in a social setting, only work.
He is awkward and uncomforting relaying emotional information to Rachel.
When subject to an event of high emotional impact, such as when he shoots Zora or witnesses Roy's 
animalistic howling, he undergoes physical shakes instead of healthy emotional expressions. 
It's clear that scientific advancements in artificial intelligence have caused society to become emotionally isolated.
It therefore challenges what it means to be human.

Tyrell, 
“Rachel is an experiment. Nothing more.”

In conclusion, *Blade Runner* portrays scientific technologies in bio-engineering, robotics and artificial intelligence as having harmful effects on society.
As a result of these technologies, society is shown to be disrupted from nature, emotionally devoid and self-centered.
Therefore, the film portrays science as a force of evil, warning of its catastrophic consequences if left unchecked.
