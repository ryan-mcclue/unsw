# The Dangers of Science

Scientific technologies have the potential to negatively influence many aspects of life.
In Ridley Scott's film *Blade Runner* (1982), science is shown to be a force of evil. 
The film explores how the pursuit of scentific developments in the areas of bioengineering,
cybernetics and artificial intelligence (AI) can have catastrophic results. 
These results are portrayed through the depiction of a society that is devoid of natural life and emotion. 

In *Blade Runner* (1982), scientific progress is portrayed as a means to create synthetic life.
Such developments are shown to have a harmful effect on society by causing the removal of natural life. 
Progress in the field of bioengineering is shown through the creation of synthetic organs.
Undifferentiated stem cells can be cultivated to differentiate into specific cell types based on the desired organ (Ajmal, L. et al. 2023).
This science is highlighted when the camera pans across Dr Chew's lab, showcasing synthetic eyes.
J.F Sebastian also alludes to this science, where he remarks "Cause I do genetic design work".
Advancements in cybernetics have allowed for the creation of agents that are physically superior to humans.
Powered orthosis is the process of adding energy to supporting plastic/metal that's molded to a limb to augment its function (Collins, S. H. 2019).
This technology is evidenced where Tyrell states "More human than human is our motto" and when Inspector Bryant comments on the Replicants "They were designed to copy human beings in every way".
As a result of these innovations, society devalues natural things, which ultimately leads to their removal.
A dystopian landscape is depicted to show the consequences of a society with nothing natural. 
Expansive views of the city reveal an overwhelming presence of pollution, dirty machinery, unkept roads and absolutely no greenery.
Dim lighting in conjunction with a persistent smog obscures the visibility of the city's human inhabitants who are the only things natural.
This minimises the importance of the human presence, making them appear almost incidental, having been consumed by surrounding industrialisation.
The bright spotlights that constantly sweep through windows disturb the normally dark ambience.
The spotlights act as a metaphor for the Sun's rays, symbolising the reversal of normally comforting natural light.
The presence of the bonsai tree in Tyrell's office appears out of place, standing out as a remnant of the natural world in a starkly artificial environment. 
When Deckard asks Rachel about her owl "Is it artificial?", she immedietely replies with "of course" emphasising that having something natural is against societal norms.
Tyrell's supreme opulence and high regard as the "god father of bioengineering" positions him as representative of what society aspires to live like.
His building towering above the ground is symbolic of his god-like status and living so far apart from the natural world. 
It's clear that scientific advancements in bioengineering and cybernetics are portrayed as causing the removal of natural life by substituting organic lifeforms with artificial counterparts.
Science is therefore shown to be a force of evil.

Scientific advancements in *Blade Runner* (1982) are also portrayed as allowing for the emulation of emotions.
The detrimental affects of these are demonstrated by presenting a society that has devalued the importance of emotion.
Developments in the field of AI are witnessed through the varied emotions and behaviours that the Replicant's exhibit.
With machine learning models using human electroencephalograms (EEGs) data, a psuedo emotional classifier can be trained that can imitate the way humans react (Palmer, N. 2023).
Roy's ability to deliver an incredibly heartfelt monologue "All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain" is indicative of this technology.
The Replicant's versatility and adaptability is further evidence of additional AI innovations.
Large language models (LLMs) can be trained on custom data so they can learn about an individual and generate responses tailored specifically for them (Replit AI Team, 2023).
A billboard advertising the Replicants with the text "Use your new friend as a personal body servant or a tireless field hand" shows their varied nature.
The emotions of the Replicants are contrasted with the absence of emotions in society.
As the Replicants are fundamentally artificial, emotions are therefore viewed as artificial.
The opening credits set the scene for an emotionally anemic society.
The white text on black background is deviod of colour and vitality.
The soundtrack is also exclusively digital synthesised music, underscoring how even the organic quality of traditional music has been replaced by the synthetic.
The text mentions 'retiring' Replicants, which is a flippant term for execution.
Slurs like 'skinjob' and 'skinner' also serve to dehumanise the Replicants.
The Replicants represent emotions society has lost.
Pris is cheeky, Roy is cunning, Rachel is caring, Leon is loyal and Zora is flirtatious.
The humans on the other hand are shown to have stowed away their emotions.
Tyrell callously refers to Rachel as "an experiment. Nothing more".
J.F Sebastian expresses emotional immaturity "I make friends. They're toys. My friends are toys".
Furthermore, the main protaganist Deckard is portrayed as a social loner with no friends and a very monotonous approach to life.
He is unaware that informing Rachel that she is a Replicant might upset her, highlighting that such compassion in the current society is not typical.
His indifference to the Replicants is epitomised when he says "Replicants are like any other machine".
It's clear that scientific advancements in AI have caused society to become emotionally isolated.
Science is therefore shown to be a force of evil.

In conclusion, *Blade Runner* (1982) portrays scientific technologies in bioengineering, cybernetics and AI as having harmful effects on society.
As a result of these technologies, society is shown to be disrupted from nature and emotionally devoid.
Therefore, the film portrays science as a force of evil, warning of humanity's place in a future where technology is left unchecked.
