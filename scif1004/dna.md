ribose means sugar

information contained in polymor of nucleotide monomers
a substitution mutation would say have an A not matching with complementary T
dna in chromosomes in nucleus

enzymes unwind dna and makes an rna copy which instructs ribosome of which 3 bases make an amino acid of which make proteins
so, detecting genes can determine what proteins will be made and if correctly, e.g. p-53 gene controls p-53 protein which controls cell growth, i.e. cancer
everyone has mutations, they aren't necessarily bad

dna detection takes millions of sequences and sees if their bases match with yours to form a double helix 

glucose reader has a molecule on electrode that oxidises glucose to produce electron
similary, pregnancy kit checks urine for certain hormone
however, dna is nucleus and has to extracted, purified and amplified before detection; so rapid detection not there (perhaps for a few sequences)

can't really make designer babies as whilst genome project gave all letters, don't know all gene functions to sucessfully perfrom dna recombination

nature vs nurture (may have good genes but no will to suceed)

just because you have certain mutation, doesn't mean you'll get disease; only probability
