## Supporting Statement
This free-form piece is written as an article. 
It's intended to be published in a science education magazine.
The target audience is young people who are interested in pursuing a career in science and/or their parents.
It's expected that this audience has a basic understanding of fundamental scientific concepts. 
The article aims to deconstruct the glamourisation of scientists in cinema, emphasising the challenges and mistakes they face in reality.
In doing so, the article intends to provide information to assist in fostering a realistic understanding of a scientific career and encouraging resilience in the face of challenges experienced on this journey.

## Reality Check: The Complexity Behind Scientists in Film 

Scientists in film are often portrayed as infallible characters. 
They are depicted as having incredible intelligence and an ability to individually solve the most difficult of problems in a short period of time.   
In the pursuit of exciting plotlines, films can obscure the authentic scientific process.
I believe it's worth questioning the facades that cinema constructs around the figure of the scientist for the sake of younger minds interested in pursuing a career in science.
As parents often play a crucial role in guiding their children's career choices, I also believe this exploration can benefit them as well.
The disparity between film and real world science can potentially dishearten individuals who fall short of the idealised experiences they have seen on film.
In film, the speed of scientific discoveries are often exaggerated, the image of a scientist working in isolation is perpetuated and the reverence for scientists is often overly emphasised.
Scientists, akin to everyone else, are human and susceptible to making mistakes. 
When watching scientists in film, it's important to realise that film often leaves out the nuanced and undeniably human journey of a career in science.

It's common for scientific progress to be marked by long periods of time. 
Scientific research is iterative by nature to allow for thorough experimentation. 
Although this is a time consuming process, it's to ensure reliable and valid results are obtained.
In the film Outbreak (1995), Colonel Daniels and his team are able to isolate the Motaba virus in a remarkably short period of time.
Daniels instructs Major Salt to "Separate samples, thaw them and put under microscope". 
Within 8 hours they make a determination based on the samples effects on kidney cells.
Later on in a similar fashion, Major Schuler quickly ascertains that the "protein code has changed" of the new Cedar Creek strain. 
This depiction dramatically accelerates the scientific procedures involved in virus identification.
The process of sequencing a virus's genome, studying its proteins and understanding its molecular characteristics require a significant amount of time.

This can be seen in the real world SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus.
In what was considered a "technological Blitzkrieg", it took approximately 5 months from first reported case to completely sequence.

Not a matter of days or weeks.
This acclerated scientific process is also seen in the film The Day After Tomorrow (2004).
Jack Hall and his team are able to 

Nevertheless, Jack gets to work converting his “paleoclimate model” to a “forecast model” so he can predict the path of the storm. It is likely that this conversion involves building a new high-resolution grid and adding dozens of new climatic processes to the model, a task which would take months to years of work by a large team of scientists. However, Jack appears to have superhuman programming abilities: he writes all the code by himself in 24 hours!
When he has finished, he decides to get some rest until the simulation has finished running. In the real world, this would take at least a week, but Jack’s colleagues wake him up after just a few hours. Evidently, their lab has access to computing resources more powerful than anything known to science today. Then, Jack’s colleagues hand him “the results” on a single sheet of paper. Real climate model output comes in the form of terabytes of data tables, which can be converted to digital maps, animations, and time plots using special software. Jack’s model appeared to simply spit out a few numbers, and what these numbers may have referred to is beyond comprehension.

Modifying climate models to predict and understand climate change involves continuous research, data collection, and collaboration among scientists. It is an ongoing and evolving process that takes years, if not decades, to refine and improve.

The journey in science is inherently iterative and marked by continuous learning and adaptation. 
Patience and dedication are paramount, and individuals should recognize that the pursuit of knowledge is a gradual process.




Scientific breakthroughs are seldom achieved by a lone scientist. 
Due to the increasingly complex nature of contemporary science, a collaborative approach is required.
In the film The Boys From Brazil (1978), Dr Josef Mengele is presented as a lone scientist who is single handedely able to clone humans.

- "Do not question your orders. Simply obey them" to captain Mundt
- "I have created a scientific miracle" to colonel seibert
"I am a scientist. I have done my job" 
- At university of Vienna, dr remarks cloning is 'impossible' to liebermann
he had to develop 'special instruments' and 'whole micro-injection system'

good science often thrives on openness and collaboration
It's crucial not to perceive the scientific journey as one of isolation but rather as a collective effort to advance knowledge for the betterment of society. By embracing collaboration and remaining open to diverse perspectives, aspiring scientists can contribute to a more dynamic and impactful scientific landscape,

It's unlikely for society to elevate a scientist to celebrity status for their work. 
The complex and specialised knowledge involved isn't immediately relatable to the average person.

It's crucial to recognize that a lack of widespread recognition does not diminish the value of one's contributions to science, 
and individuals should not be deterred by societal expectations of fame. 
The true fulfillment lies in the passion for discovery and the impact on the scientific community, even if it may not always translate into widespread public acclaim.

Ultimately, appreciating the human, iterative, and collaborative aspects of scientific discovery allows for a more inspiring and realistic portrayal of the scientific journey.
