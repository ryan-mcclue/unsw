## Supporting Statement
This free-form piece is written as an article. 
It's intended to be published in a science education magazine.
The target audience is young people who are interested in pursuing a career in science and/or their parents.
It's expected that this audience has a basic understanding of fundamental scientific concepts. 
The article aims to deconstruct the glamourisation of scientists in cinema, emphasising the challenges and mistakes they face in reality.
In doing so, the article intends to provide information to assist in fostering a realistic understanding of a scientific career and encouraging resilience in the face of challenges experienced on this journey.

## Reality Check: The Complexity Behind Scientists in Film 

Scientists in film are often portrayed as infallible characters. 
They are depicted as having incredible intelligence and an ability to individually solve the most difficult of problems in a short period of time.   
In the pursuit of exciting plotlines, films can obscure the authentic scientific process.
I believe it's worth questioning the facades that cinema constructs around the figure of the scientist for the sake of younger minds interested in pursuing a career in science.
As parents often play a crucial role in guiding their children's career choices, I also believe this exploration can benefit them as well.
The disparity between film and real world science can potentially dishearten individuals who fall short of the idealised experiences they have seen on film.
In film, the speed of scientific discoveries are often exaggerated, the image of a scientist working in isolation is perpetuated and the reverence for scientists is often overly emphasised.
Scientists, akin to everyone else, are human and susceptible to making mistakes. 
When watching scientists in film, it's important to realise that film often leaves out the nuanced and undeniably human journey of a career in science.

It's common for scientific progress to be marked by long periods of time. 
Scientific research is iterative by nature to allow for thorough experimentation. 
Although this is a time consuming process, it's to ensure reliable and valid results are obtained.
In the film Outbreak, Sam Daniels and his team are able to isolate motaba virus.

daniels 'separate samples, thaw them and under microscope'
major 'results ready in a few hours' with a smile of face. relaxed, not looking busy

looking at pictures of testing on kidney cells with virus 8 hours.

make determination that it invades, kills and replicates in 5 hours.
even spacey remarks that 'these numbers can't be right', 
but major responds 'these numbers are correct'

* a scientific breakthrough is acheived in a short period of time
outbreak (sam daniels; vaccine development)
- isolating motaba virus
e.g. ebola 1976, sars 2002 months to identify

day after tomorrow (jack hall; climate models)
- incorporating storms into climate model and getting results in hours 
e.g. IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), released in 2007, years of refinement

good science often thrives on openness and collaboration
It's crucial not to perceive the scientific journey as one of isolation but rather as a collective effort to advance knowledge for the betterment of society. By embracing collaboration and remaining open to diverse perspectives, aspiring scientists can contribute to a more dynamic and impactful scientific landscape,

Scientific breakthroughs are seldom achieved by a lone scientist. 
Due to the increasingly complex nature of contemporary science, a collaborative approach is required.
In the film The Boys From Brazil (1978), Dr Josef Mengele is presented as a lone scientist who is single handedely able to clone humans.
the boys from brazil (josef; dolly or crispr?), 
- mengele distinguised from others wearing a white suit, people bowing to him, guest of honour commanding respect by people of many backgrounds
- "Do not question your orders. Simply obey them" to captain Mundt
- "I have created a scientific miracle" to colonel seibert
"I am a scientist. I have done my job" 
- At university of Vienna, dr remarks cloning is 'impossible' to liebermann
he had to develop 'special instruments' and 'whole micro-injection system'
lucky if 1/10 survives micro-surgery
(remarks that mengele is a primitive genetiscist)
e.g. CRISPR collaborative

ex machina (nathan bateman;)
- remove himself from humanity, nestled in nathan's isolated huge estate making his opus
him owning the powerful landscape (waterfalls, glaciers) is implicit of his power
- showing structured gel her brain that is not circuitry, face masks
- nathan remarks 'the greatest scientific event in the history of man'
e.g. self-driving cars collaboration
...
The journey in science is inherently iterative and marked by continuous learning and adaptation. 
Patience and dedication are paramount, and individuals should recognize that the pursuit of knowledge is a gradual process.

It's unlikely for society to elevate a scientist to celebrity status for their work. 
The complex and specialised knowledge involved isn't immediately relatable to the average person.

* scientist is viewed as a rock star after their innovation

positronic operating core, 'lanning's first creation' in centre of building which controls building, i.e. everyone sees it

It's crucial to recognize that a lack of widespread recognition does not diminish the value of one's contributions to science, 
and individuals should not be deterred by societal expectations of fame. 
The true fulfillment lies in the passion for discovery and the impact on the scientific community, even if it may not always translate into widespread public acclaim.

...
Ultimately, appreciating the human, iterative, and collaborative aspects of scientific discovery allows for a more inspiring and realistic portrayal of the scientific journey.
