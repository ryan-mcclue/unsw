## Supporting Statement
This free-form piece is written as an article. 
It's intended to be published in a science education magazine.
The target audience is young people who are interested in pursuing a career in science and/or their parents.
It's expected that this audience has a basic understanding of fundamental scientific concepts. 
The article aims to deconstruct the glamourisation of scientists in cinema, emphasising the challenges and mistakes they face in reality.
In doing so, the article intends to provide information to assist in fostering a realistic understanding of a scientific career and encouraging resilience in the face of challenges experienced on this journey.

## Reality Check: The Complexity Behind Scientists in Film 

Scientists in film are often portrayed as infallible characters. 
They are depicted as having incredible intelligence and an ability to individually solve the most difficult of problems in a short period of time.   
In the pursuit of exciting plotlines, films can obscure the authentic scientific process.
I believe it's worth questioning the facades that cinema constructs around the figure of the scientist for the sake of younger minds interested in pursuing a career in science.
As parents often play a crucial role in guiding their children's career choices, I also believe this exploration can benefit them as well.
The disparity between film and real world science can potentially dishearten individuals who fall short of the idealised experiences they have seen on film.
In film, the speed of scientific discoveries are often exaggerated, the image of a scientist working in isolation is perpetuated and the reverence for scientists is often overly emphasised.
Scientists, akin to everyone else, are human and susceptible to making mistakes. 
When watching scientists in film, it's important to realise that film often leaves out the nuanced and undeniably human journey of a career in science.

It's common for scientific progress to be marked by long periods of time. 
Scientific research is iterative by nature to allow for thorough experimentation. 
Although this is a time consuming process, it's to ensure reliable and valid results are obtained.
In the film Outbreak (1995), Colonel Daniels and his team are able to isolate the Motaba virus in a remarkably short period of time.
Daniels instructs Major Salt to "Separate samples, thaw them and put under microscope". 
Within 8 hours they make a determination based on the samples effects on kidney cells.
Later on in a similar fashion, Major Schuler quickly ascertains that the "protein code has changed" of the new Cedar Creek strain. 
This depiction dramatically accelerates the scientific procedures involved in virus identification.
The process of sequencing a virus's genome, studying its proteins and understanding its molecular characteristics require a significant amount of time (Dothard, M. et al. 2019).
This can be seen in the real world SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus.
In what was considered a "technological Blitzkrieg", it took approximately 5 months from the first reported case to completely sequence (Cherry, J., and Krogstad, P., 2004).
Not a matter of a few days or weeks.
This acclerated scientific process is also seen in the film The Day After Tomorrow (2004).
Jack Hall and his team are able to convert their climate model to "factor in storm scenarios" as suggested by Janet Tokada.
This modification is made and subsequent results obtained within 24 hours.
From this, they are able to make the claim that in 6 to 8 weeks, there will be a "major climate shift".
In reality, modeling the intracacies of climatic processes takes months to years.
Not only this, but the results of these models output significant amounts of data to sift through. 
A series of numbers that are easily interpreted are not what is produced (Naughten, K., 2012).
An example of a climate model in the real world is IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Fourth Assessment Report.
Extensive research and data collection over a period of years took place to develop this.
It was an evolving, intricate process that couldn't simply factor in a weather scenario without many points of refinement (IPCC Team, 2024).
It's important for aspiring scientists to not be disheartened by a lack of quick results. 
Scientific progress is inherently iterative and requires continuous learning and adaptation.
Embrace the complexity and remember that patience and dedication are paramount.


Scientific breakthroughs are seldom achieved by a lone scientist. 
Due to the increasingly complex nature of contemporary science, a collaborative approach is required.
In the film The Boys From Brazil (1978), Dr Josef Mengele is presented as a lone scientist who is single handedely able to clone humans.

- mengele distinguised from others wearing a white suit, people bowing to him, guest of honour commanding respect by people of many backgrounds
- "Do not question your orders. Simply obey them" to captain Mundt
- "I have created a scientific miracle" to colonel seibert
"I am a scientist. I have done my job" 
- At university of Vienna, dr remarks cloning is 'impossible' to liebermann
he had to develop 'special instruments' and 'whole micro-injection system'
lucky if 1/10 survives micro-surgery
(remarks that mengele is a primitive genetiscist)

good science often thrives on openness and collaboration
It's crucial not to perceive the scientific journey as one of isolation but rather as a collective effort to advance knowledge for the betterment of society. By embracing collaboration and remaining open to diverse perspectives, aspiring scientists can contribute to a more dynamic and impactful scientific landscape,

It's unlikely for society to elevate a scientist to celebrity status for their work. 
The complex and specialised knowledge involved isn't immediately relatable to the average person.

It's crucial to recognize that a lack of widespread recognition does not diminish the value of one's contributions to science, 
and individuals should not be deterred by societal expectations of fame. 
The true fulfillment lies in the passion for discovery and the impact on the scientific community, even if it may not always translate into widespread public acclaim.

...
Ultimately, appreciating the human, iterative, and collaborative aspects of scientific discovery allows for a more inspiring and realistic portrayal of the scientific journey.
