## Supporting Statement
This free-form piece is written as an article. 
It's intended to be published in a science education magazine.
The target audience is young people who are interested in pursuing a career in science and/or their parents.
It's expected that this audience has a basic understanding of fundamental scientific concepts. 
The article aims to deconstruct the glamourisation of scientists in cinema, emphasising the challenges and mistakes they face in reality.
In doing so, the article intends to provide information to assist in fostering a realistic understanding of a scientific career and encouraging resilience in the face of challenges experienced on this journey.

## Reality Check: The Complexity Behind Scientific Heroes in Film 

Scientists in film are often portrayed as infallible characters. 
They are depicted as having incredible intelligence and an ability to solve the most difficult of problems in a short period of time.   
In the pursuit of exciting plotlines, films can obscure the authentic scientific struggle.
I believe it's worth questioning the facades that cinema constructs around the figure of the scientist for the sake of younger minds interested in pursuing a career in science.
The disparity between film and real world science can potentially dishearten individuals who fall short of the idealised experiences they have seen on film.
It's important to recognise that actual scientific innovations involve persistent challenges, collaborative efforts and moments of uncertainty. 
For example, it took ... and was not an overnight discovery
Furthermore, the speed of is ... (consider covid vaccine speed)
In addition how society views is ... (consider inventor of transistor no one knows)
Film often leaves out the nuanced and undeniably human journey of a career in science.

Scientists, akin to everyone else, are human and susceptible to making mistakes. 
When watching films, it's beneficial to bear in mind that while the scientific content might be accurate, the speed of discoveries is often exaggerated, the lifestyle of the scientist is glamorized, and the reverence for scientists is often overly emphasized.

It's important to understand that Real world science often involves persistent challenges, setbacks, moments of uncertainty and long time scales. 
Scientists are humans like the rest of us and make mistakes.
Often in film, it's good to keep in mind that the science shown might be accurate, but the speed of discoveries is exaggerated, the lifestyle of the scientist glamourised and the reverence of the scientist is overhyped


Message to Convey/purpose: This feature article aims to deconstruct the heroization of scientists in cinema, emphasizing the human aspects, challenges, and mistakes they face. 
The message seeks to encourage young STEM enthusiasts by providing a more realistic and relatable view of the scientific journey.
This feature article aims to address the heroization of scientists in cinema, providing a critical perspective for young STEM enthusiasts. 

By dismantling the myth of the infallible scientist, the article seeks to encourage a more authentic and resilient approach to pursuing careers in science and technology.

Parents often play a crucial role in guiding their children's educational and career choices, 
and understanding the nuances of how scientists are portrayed in cinema can help them provide more informed guidance. 
The article can offer insights into the potential impact of cinematic representations on children's perceptions of scientists and the scientific journey. 
Additionally, it can provide parents with information on fostering a realistic understanding of STEM careers and encouraging resilience in the face of challenges.

Give detailed outline for:
An article/magazine piece/editorial that comes under the general headline 'Science and the Cinema'.
The author discusses how films heroise scientists and how this can affect the perception of young people interested in science.
e.g. disingenuous of the scientific struggle obscuring the fact that scientists are human and can make mistakes,
might dissuade younger people from persisting as they couldn't achieve such feats
The target audience is young people interested in STEM.


It is to contain these topics and associated films:
* Genes/DNA: Blade Runner
* De-Extinction: Jurassic Park
* Viruses: Outbreak
* Gattaca:

* De-Extinction: Jurassic Park (tassie tiger, wooly mammoth etc.)
* Viruses: Outbreak (injecting serum)

movies occur in short time lines so have to exaggerate progress
