submit ‘a body of work’ that comes under the general headline
‘Science and the Cinema

but allows you to amalgamate all that you have learnt during your time studying on
this course.

It is up to you to use the knowledge that you have gained on this
course with your own unique skill set to create a submission that addresses the topic.
(something with comp. sci)

All work should have some information regarding
the target audience and aim of the piece too vide infra. If supporting information is not given,
then your work will score very poorly as without context we do not know what you are
creating or if you have the correct level of science for the audience.

Do not use the 2500 word comment to mean you have to write 2500
words. Also remember that the limits I provided are for the entire body of work, not just the
potential article, you have supporting information too

Ultimately I would say to add in any and
all parts of the planning of your work including any research you did (providing it is in a
reasonable state), you will need references no matter what you submit and you will need
some supporting statements to contextualise your piece (we need to know what you intended
to create so we can accurately assess you)
