Give detailed outline for:
An article/magazine piece/editorial that comes under the general headline 'Science and the Cinema'.
The author discusses how films heroise scientists and how this can affect the perception of young people interested in science.
e.g. disingenuous of the scientific struggle obscuring the fact that scientists are human and can make mistakes,
might dissuade younger people from persisting as they couldn't achieve such feats
The target audience is young people interested in STEM.


It is to contain these topics and associated films:
* Genes/DNA: Blade Runner
* De-Extinction: Jurassic Park
* Viruses: Outbreak
