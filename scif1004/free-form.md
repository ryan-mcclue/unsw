## Supporting Statement
This free-form piece is written as an article. 
It's intended to be published in a science education magazine.
The target audience is young people who are interested in pursuing a career in science and/or their parents.
It's expected that this audience has a basic understanding of fundamental scientific concepts. 
The article aims to deconstruct the glamourisation of scientists in cinema, emphasising the challenges and mistakes they face in reality.
In doing so, the article intends to provide information to assist in fostering a realistic understanding of a scientific career and encouraging resilience in the face of challenges experienced on this journey.

## Reality Check: The Complexity Behind Scientists in Film 

Scientists in film are often portrayed as infallible characters. 
They are depicted as having incredible intelligence and an ability to individually solve the most difficult of problems in a short period of time.   
In the pursuit of exciting plotlines, films can obscure the authentic scientific process.
I believe it's worth questioning the facades that cinema constructs around the figure of the scientist for the sake of younger minds interested in pursuing a career in science.
As parents often play a crucial role in guiding their children's career choices, I also believe this exploration can benefit them as well.
The disparity between film and real world science can potentially dishearten individuals who fall short of the idealised experiences they have seen on film.
In film, the speed of scientific discoveries are often exaggerated, the image of a scientist working in isolation is perpetuated and the reverence for scientists is often overly emphasised.
Scientists, akin to everyone else, are human and susceptible to making mistakes. 
When watching scientists in film, it's important to realise that film often leaves out the nuanced and undeniably human journey of a career in science.

Scientific breakthroughs are seldom achieved by a lone scientist. 
Due to the increasingly complex nature of contemporary science, a collaborative approach is required.
In 

e.g. mRNA vaccine
Take, for instance, the development of the mRNA vaccine. While the names of key figures like Dr. Katalin Karik√≥ and Dr. Drew Weissman are associated with the foundational work in mRNA technology, the collaborative efforts of interdisciplinary teams, including molecular biologists, pharmacologists, clinicians, statisticians, and regulatory experts, were essential.

It's unlikely for a single scientist to achieve a breakthrough in weekend. it would take a lot longer.
e.g. CRISPR

It's unlikely for society to view a scientist with rockstar fandom from an innovation
e.g. transistor

consider the points that movies often misrepresent about scientists:
* a single scientist is able to acheive an innovation largely by themselves
the boys from brazil (josef; dolly or crispr?), 
- mengele distinguised from others wearing a white suit, people bowing to him, guest of honour commanding respect by people of many backgrounds
- "Do not question your orders. Simply obey them" to captain Mundt
- "I have created a scientific miracle" to colonel seibert
"I am a scientist. I have done my job" 
- At university of Vienna, dr remarks cloning is 'impossible' to liebermann
he had to develop 'special instruments' and 'whole micro-injection system'
lucky if 1/10 survives micro-surgery
(remarks that mengele is a primitive genetiscist)

ex machina (bateman;)
- remove himself from humanity, nestled in nathan's isolated huge estate making his opus
him owning the powerful landscape (waterfalls, glaciers) is implicit of his power
- showing structured gel her brain that is not circuitry, face masks
- nathan remarks 'the greatest scientific event in the history of man'

* a scientific breakthrough is acheived in a short period of time
outbreak (sam daniels; vaccine development)
- isolating motaba virus
day after tomorrow (dennis; climate models)
- incorporating storms into climate model and getting results in hours 
* scientist is viewed as a rock star after their innovation
blade runner (tyrell; transistor); 

i robot (lanning; asimo);


outbreak:
Misrepresentation 2: The timeline of finding a cure in the movie is compressed for dramatic effect. In real-world scenarios, vaccine development and approval take a much longer time, involving extensive clinical trials and regulatory processes.

blade runner:
Misrepresentation 1: Blade Runner features the character of Tyrell, a scientist who appears to be the sole creator of highly advanced humanoid robots. The reality of artificial intelligence development involves interdisciplinary teams and collaborative efforts.
Misrepresentation 3: Tyrell is a powerful and influential figure, but the film questions the ethical implications of his creations and challenges the notion of a celebrated scientist as a rockstar.

the boys from brazil:
Misrepresentation 1: The film involves a plot where a single scientist, Dr. Josef Mengele, attempts to clone Adolf Hitler. The scientific and ethical complexities of cloning and genetic engineering are oversimplified for dramatic effect.

day after tomorrow:
Misrepresentation 1: The film presents a climatologist, Jack Hall, as the singular expert who predicts and addresses extreme climate events. 
In reality, climate science involves collaboration among experts across various disciplines.




It's important to understand that Real world science often involves persistent challenges, setbacks, moments of uncertainty and long time scales. 
Scientists are humans like the rest of us and make mistakes.
Often in film, it's good to keep in mind that the science shown might be accurate, but the speed of discoveries is exaggerated, the lifestyle of the scientist glamourised and the reverence of the scientist is overhyped


Message to Convey/purpose: This feature article aims to deconstruct the heroization of scientists in cinema, emphasizing the human aspects, challenges, and mistakes they face. 
The message seeks to encourage young STEM enthusiasts by providing a more realistic and relatable view of the scientific journey.
This feature article aims to address the heroization of scientists in cinema, providing a critical perspective for young STEM enthusiasts. 

By dismantling the myth of the infallible scientist, the article seeks to encourage a more authentic and resilient approach to pursuing careers in science and technology.

Parents often play a crucial role in guiding their children's educational and career choices, 
and understanding the nuances of how scientists are portrayed in cinema can help them provide more informed guidance. 
The article can offer insights into the potential impact of cinematic representations on children's perceptions of scientists and the scientific journey.

Give detailed outline for:
An article/magazine piece/editorial that comes under the general headline 'Science and the Cinema'.
The author discusses how films heroise scientists and how this can affect the perception of young people interested in science.
e.g. disingenuous of the scientific struggle obscuring the fact that scientists are human and can make mistakes,
might dissuade younger people from persisting as they couldn't achieve such feats
The target audience is young people interested in STEM.


It is to contain these topics and associated films:
* Genes/DNA: Blade Runner
* De-Extinction: Jurassic Park
* Viruses: Outbreak
