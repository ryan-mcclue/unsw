The medieval rebirth of flat-earth argument attempts to use hyperbole to sway uneducated readers by only postulating reasons for it, e.g. flight paths whilst not mentioning its own flaws

Solar system is rocky planets, then asteriod belt and then gas giants starting with jupiter

Rocket will have disposable fuel modules, lunar module, service module and command module (where astronauts live)

Van allen belt trapping radiation determines satellite heights, have to protect leaving earth 

Moon not large enough gravitational pull to keep an atmosphere

Apollo 1 pre-fire
Apollo 11 lm still there
Apollo 13 near disaster

Now for other planets:
 - Mercury very hot and cold as solar radiation removed any atmosphere 
 - Venus always hot as CO2 atmosphere extreme greenhouse effect
 - Mars cold

Interesting technology like sustainable moon base, new craft to deal with different planet conditions (perhaps underground in mars to protect from radiation), psychology endurance simulations
The process of developing this has applications for Earth as well

Nearest star alpha centeari 4years at speed of light; so worm hole, warp space time, or generation ship required

## Apollo 13

## Martian
